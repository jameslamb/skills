    "# Extract \"Meat\" from Job Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: many job descriptions have lots of text that isn't important. In fact, our methodology for pulling JD information is to take *_all_* visible text from a JD's website, which means that lots of it is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document cleans the JDs and prepares them for analysis. Here are the steps:\n",
    "1. Look at a few JDs for each text. Identify the trends. Typically, the \"meat\" will start after the same line, or a series of lines. \n",
    "2. Remove everything that's not meat.\n",
    "3. Make a dictionary. Key is job title, value is meat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process notes:\n",
    "- Lowercase e'rrything.\n",
    "- Strip each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Questions\n",
    "- How to handle \"team\" (currently: ignore, because it's organized differently by organization).\n",
    "\n",
    "### End State\n",
    "- Each word in the list of skills across all companies is a dimension; value is tf-idf (on post-processed skill words)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "- The `.DS_Store` file that macOS autogenerates really fucks with this process. Remove it before running any of the scripts that iterate through directories.\n",
    "- Slashes in job titles mess up the file writing."
