Okta 57--Senior_Group-Product-Manager-Universal-Directory-And-Directory-Integrations-|-Okta.Txt


our customers use okta both to power their internal enterprise and to build apps for their customers and partners. in both cases, customers want the benefits, flexibility and innovation that a modern cloud directory provides, while managing the reality of having an extensive and deeply integrated on-premises infrastructure.
explosive growth in collaboration and the types of connected devices, driven by employees bringing their own devices and the internet of things (iot), mean that the modern directory needs to track, map and provide the full richness of this data and their relationships. further, all these challenges must be met at massive scale with best-in-class security and performance. okta's universal directory is the foundational product that allows okta to solve these critical customer problems and build the identity and mobility infrastructure of the future.
in this role, you'll be defining the product strategy and direction for okta's directory product, how okta works with common on-premises 3 rd -party directories (e.g., ldap and active directory), modern cloud-based directories like google, aws, and azure ad, and how we differentiate against other products in the market. in addition, you'll be setting the roadmap for the product by defining, prioritizing, building and delivering user scenarios and features to drive that strategy forward.
