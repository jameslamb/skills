Square Ios Engineer, Payment Product

ios engineer, payment product
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
payments is square's core product and the foundation for the growth of many other square products. millions of merchants use the payments product for their business every day. the payment product team focuses on improving the end-to-end user experience for these merchants and on building new user-facing tools to help them better manage the payment aspect of their business. a few examples of the products that we work on:
in-app terminal, which is the payments experience in the square pos app, often with a reader.
virtual terminal, which provides a way for merchants to take payments in a browser without a reader.
card on file, which allows merchants to store buyers' cards for future payments.
instant deposits, which enables merchants to immediately deposit their credit card sales in their bank for a fee.
onboarding and new user experience for payment products.
transaction and deposit reporting.
referral program.
