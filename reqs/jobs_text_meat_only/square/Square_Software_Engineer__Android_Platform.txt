Square Software Engineer, Android Platform

software engineer, android platform
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
square's hardware team builds the tangible connection to square. we started with a simple and elegant reader that turns any phone or tablet into a mobile point of sale - and we continue to lead this category with advances in chip card and nfc technology. next, we introduced the square stand, the best way to turn your ipad into a countertop point of sale. as we introduce more products, we will meet the needs of more and more sellers with stand-out hardware products, globally. in this role, you will be developing the platform that powers square's hardware products.
