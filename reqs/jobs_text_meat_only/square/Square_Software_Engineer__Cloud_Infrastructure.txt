Square Software Engineer, Cloud Infrastructure

software engineer, cloud infrastructure
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
as a software engineer on the cloud infrastructure team you'll be part of a small, agile team that enables the use of cloud-based technologies by square in a secure, cost-effective and regulation-compliant manner. you will architect
new pathways to the cloud for data and services
that aim to be minimally constraining to our product engineers and provide fast, unencumbered means to using cloud-based technologies to anyone at square.
you should feel at home working in and around the google cloud platform and have a good understanding of how to construct data delivery and software release pipelines that scale in a nearly limitless cloud environment. you should have a good understanding of defense-in-depth approaches to software system design and understand how to deliver cloud-based solutions that can protect our customers and their data. you love building new systems as much as you love adapting existing technologies to solve new problems in novel ways.
