we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
our software engineers are responsible for keeping square simple and making our users faster and smarter by giving them a designed payments experience and rich data surrounding each transaction. we're looking for smart engineers of all shapes and sizes, capable and excited about building world-class software and solving hard problems. our challenges span many technologies, from web and mobile applications (ios, android) to server-side development (java and/or ruby). our engineers work on small teams with people across engineering, product, and creative, building reliable, fast, responsive, and beautiful software.
design: implement pixel perfect designs that defy user expectations.
reliability: ensure square works right, every time, by using testing, continuous integration, and in-depth code reviews.
security: create interactions and apis that reinforce trust, increase security, and make it harder to do the wrong thing.
analytics: collect all the data around every transaction and turn it into tools that help our users.
products: envision entire new products, features, and flows that are inspired, considered, and magical.
fraud: make quick decisions on millions of dollars which require sound judgment, thorough diligence, and passion for detecting bad actors and preventing loss.
