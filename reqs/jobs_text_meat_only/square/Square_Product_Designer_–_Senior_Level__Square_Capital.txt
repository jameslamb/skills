Square Product Designer – Senior Level, Square Capital

product designer – senior level, square capital
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy, so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all. we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly. we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, and helping the ice cream shop pay its employees.
and, with square capital, we have extended over $1 billion in funding to our sellers, helping them manage their cashflow and making it easy to invest in and grow their business. let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. and make it easier for customers to shop and pay at their favorite businesses. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone. our small, highly collaborative team has built our foundational product and is now focused on innovating and experimenting beyond traditional lending products. we're an integral and growing part of the square ecosystem and are leveraging our position to build products and features that are beyond the capabilities of our competitors.

from the beginning, design has played a central role in square's product development process.
whether it's crafting the user interface our sellers rely on to run their businesses or designing a landing page for a new product, the design team is involved at every step. we're responsible for creating the brand promise customers have in their first interaction with square capital and ensuring we deliver on that promise in every aspect of the experience.

it's crucial we communicate confidence and credibility at every step.
the capital design team is highly collaborative and you will work closely with product managers, engineers, marketers, and data scientists to create world-class experiences for our customers. as a member of our team, you will be responsible for the design and execution of our customers' experiences with our square capital product. this includes feature development, information architecture, visual design, prototyping and overseeing implementation.
this is a high impact role and we're looking for someone motivated by complex problems. you'll be directly responsible for decisions that influence the product and roadmap. on this team your work will span from core features to experimental projects. we believe in generalists who have a hand in each stage of the product development process, so product designers at square take projects from napkin sketches to final visual specifications.
