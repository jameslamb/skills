what current team members say
the developer platform team has grown rapidly, and we've been so fortunate to keep adding great teammates to the 'family.'
we went from 5 to 30+ people in the last ~18 months. here ares quotes directly from your future teammates:
culture:
"i was looking for a company where the aim is to collaborate and empower each other. square has that on its dna and also on its business model. as long as merchants and developers sell more and do better, square does well. so it's a win-win setting that translates in the way teams and people work together."
learning opportunities:
"after asking on several interviews how was knowledge shared across team members and teams i found out that the openness and size of square would allow me to learn more and have an open mind to digging into different technologies and languages. great big companies also have this but they are so massive that's easy to get lost."
career growth and balance:
"i also consider the size of the company a great one for me to grow professionally on my career without sacrificing my other goals in life. work life balance is a big deal for me too."
people: "
square was the place where i felt treated the best (compared to my other interviews). i am not talking about what things you can do / swag / lunch or other goodies you can get. i'm referring to the way i was welcomed, listened to, questions answered, and even they way i was escorted out the day i interviewed, and my follow ups with the recruiter and you [, my hiring manager]."
