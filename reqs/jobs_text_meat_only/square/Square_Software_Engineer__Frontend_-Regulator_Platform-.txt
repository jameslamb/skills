Square Software Engineer, Frontend (Regulator Platform)

software engineer, frontend (regulator platform)
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
regulator platform builds and runs the common infrastructure, dashboard, and workflow management that allow square employees (especially support, risk, and compliance) to quickly research and resolve customer issues. key parts of this project involve integrating with and corralling data from all of square's products to paint a coherent picture of square's customers as they exist now or existed at a point in time, and then arranging all the actions that can be taken in order to resolve an issue.
we care about a solid, scalable, efficient, and straightforward ux for the hundreds of squares who use our team's internal products daily. at the same time, to keep up with square's rapid growth of new products, we must approach aspects of regulator as key square infrastructure, making it easy for other engineers to jump into it, make quick progress, and not risk destabilizing the system for current users.
we work with a designer who has many more ideas than we can currently implement and would like to implement the next major version of our ui, but need to find the right person for the job.
implement a significant new navigational system for regulator that provides an intuitive hierarchy of information, while allowing regulator to keep pace with new product additions coming from register, cash, and eventually caviar
understand back-end services (ideally ruby on rails) but be primarily interested in working within our ember + javascript front-end
take ownership over the structure and principles that guide our front-end development in regulator, while contributing opinions on the back-end structuring of information that needs to be surfaced in the ui
help keep us up-to-date with the latest ui frameworks, occasionally interacting with square's web front end team to ensure consistency between our internal and their external-facing dashboards
have or develop strong expertise in css, using current best practices and working with our designer on a style-guide that lets us quickly communicate style expectations with other engineers while ensuring consistent styling throughout regulator
help us run roll-out concurrently running versions of our ui so that we can safely try out new uis without unduly disrupting anybody's work
interact with various product team engineers to help them successfully incorporate administrative access to their products in our platform
learn about square's major product offerings, while developing systems that remain reliable in spite of occasionally unreliable vendors
get to know and interact directly with key internal customers on requests and ui issues with the goal of improving efficiency and improving square's bottom line
ba/bs degree or equivalent practical experience
strong front-end ui inclinations, with strong javascript experience, ideally in an mvc framework such as ember or react
some experience developing and debugging server-side code
technologies we use and teach:
javascript, ember, qunit, ruby on rails, rspec
s2s architecture, rest apis, protobufs
mysql, redis, hive, and vertica
