we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. and make it easier for customers to shop and pay at their favorite businesses. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
as square is expanding to meet the needs of a broader seller base, including growing our payments business and upmarket seller base, as well as the caviar, capital, and point of sale lines of business, square's seller dashboard plays an increasingly important role. square's seller dashboard's position in further enabling sellers of all kinds to start, run, and grow their businesses through advanced workflows and automation, is core to our growth plans. you will own driving ambitious seller efficiency metrics, and own health of the platform from deep in the stack through end user experience. we focus on enabling every seller to have a streamlined, useful, and impactful experience on dashboard, while also driving concrete, tangible metrics like conversion rates and uptime, and daily active and monthly active dashboard users. these efforts translate to reduced churn, increased lifetime value and dramatic growth in square's total payments volume and saas engagement. to accomplish this you will work with our executive leadership team and business leaders to hone and deliver on this explicit investment strategy. if you're looking to impact the growth and direction of a company, you will find this role compelling, challenging, and rewarding.
