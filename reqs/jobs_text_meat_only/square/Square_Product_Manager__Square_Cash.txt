Square Product Manager, Square Cash

product manager, square cash
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
as square cash expands to meet the needs of a broader base of consumers, we're focused on going deep to rethink every single element of the consumer card experience. the cash card is the first step in that evolution. the cash card is a debit card that square cash customers can use to spend their balances. you will own the cash card product from end to end, including but not limited to infrastructure, r&d, materials strategy, fulfillment process, vendor & partner management, cost and speed optimization, card activation, pricing and more. these efforts translate to increased greater customer satisfaction, higher activation rates and increased engagement and spending volume from customers. to accomplish this you will work with our executive leadership team and business leaders to hone and deliver on this explicit investment strategy. if you're looking to impact the growth and direction of a company, you will find this role compelling, challenging, and rewarding.
