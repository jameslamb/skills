Square Software Engineer, Automation (Mobile Ci, Ios)

software engineer, automation (mobile ci, ios)
we started with a simple idea—that everyone should be able to accept credit cards—and we've been rethinking buying and selling ever since.
for sellers, we're creating one cohesive service to run your entire business, from a register in your pocket to analytics on your laptop. for buyers, we're making it faster to order from the businesses you love and more fun to pay your friends back.
buying and selling sound like simple things—and they should be. somewhere along the way, they got complicated. we're working hard to make commerce easy for everyone.
the mobile ci team at square operates several mission-critical systems that perform automated builds and tests for ios and android application developers. we aim for build and test jobs to happen quickly and precisely, allowing square's mobile teams to ship efficiently.
on our team you'll aim to increase development velocity. we believe that reliable infrastructure and tooling has a tangible impact on overall software and hardware quality. you'll address tool needs from a foundation level on up by providing cpu and storage bandwidth to build & test workloads, writing more efficient and easier to use tooling, and designing internal web-pages and api integrations that allow developers to visualize and examine the results of the continuous integration process.
you should feel at home working in and around a broad swath of technologies, and understanding the day-to-day frictions of development work in each. you love building new systems from the ground up as much as you love tweaking existing systems to achieve maximum performance. in this role you'll be working with square's mobile teams to develop unified solutions that allow developers to move faster and have greater confidence when they release software.
