Square Product Designer - Senior Level

product designer - senior level
atlanta, ga
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
from the beginning, it's been part of our core business strategy that product design play a central role in our product development process. at this point in our growth, we're hiring designers into senior roles to lead the creation of brand new product lines, and to design the evolution of some of our keystone products in an effort to create amazing experiences for our customers. we believe in generalists that have a hand in each stage of product design, so designers at square take projects from napkin sketches to final visual specifications. we pride ourselves on rethinking established paradigms and redefining elegance in software.
