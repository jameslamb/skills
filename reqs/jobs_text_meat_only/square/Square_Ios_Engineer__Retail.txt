Square Ios Engineer, Retail

ios engineer, retail
new york, ny
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their businessâ€”and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
being a retailer is all about information. what merchandise has the best return on investment? which employees are great at closing a sale? which customers would make another purchase, if only they knew about my latest product line? do i have this in my customer's favorite color at my store across town?
square for retail is square's all-in-one answer to these questions. by combining an optimized point of sale, advanced inventory tools, and customer and employee management into one integrated product, we are building the best way to run a retail business. our team is focused on building impactful software for retailers, by measuring what works, changing what doesn't, and building new features where necessary. we are tactical in adding new functionality where we need it, but work closely with other teams to embrace and extend square's underlying platform. based in new york city, we benefit from the resources of the larger square organization and have the space to focus and innovate.
