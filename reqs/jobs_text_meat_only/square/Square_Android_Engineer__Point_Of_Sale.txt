Square Android Engineer, Point Of Sale

android engineer, point of sale
we believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. so we're building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  we started with a little white credit card reader but haven't stopped there. our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and nfc payments, and our cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   we're empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  let's shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. we're here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.

the point of sale team serves two sets of customers: we build the square point of sale app (
https://squareup.com/pos
), which is used by millions of sellers around the world to run their businesses every day. we also build the square point of sale platform, which is a foundational set of apis and components used to build other square products. both of these customers are at the heart of square's business – you're directly contributing to what the world recognizes as square.
engineers on the point of sale team have the opportunity to work on both features and platform / infrastructure. on any day, you might work with a backend engineer to debug an issue in a new server-side service, talk to a designer to get the ux of a feature just right, or work with infrastructure and platform teams to determine how best to modularize a feature for reuse. our engineers enjoy working on all parts of our apps, and can tie all this work together to ship a high quality feature.
