so, you're not only well versed in infrastructure and operations, but also in developing software that can run it for you. you support application developers by building and exposing well designed tools, apis and services. you hate waking up at 2am to production failures and that's why you have monitors for everything, and enough failover or self-healing setup so you can deal with it in the morning. you're fine with rolling out code all the time because if anything unexpected happens, you have it covered. you did this already. twice. so you automated it. and when the caching system had a problem, you found the bug, fixed it and sent them a patch.
