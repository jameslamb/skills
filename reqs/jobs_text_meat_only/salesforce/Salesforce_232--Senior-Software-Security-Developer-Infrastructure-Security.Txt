Salesforce 232--Senior-Software-Security-Developer-Infrastructure-Security.Txt






the security team at salesforce is building a brand new platform for network segmentation and access control of inter-service communication. we are looking at a state-of-the-art framework that provides automated translation from user specifications of service access rules to various access control points in our cloud infrastructure where these rules are enforced. this control platform spawns different networking layers (from containers, vms, physical servers and networking devices) and technologies (network segmentation, firewalls, hypervisor

and tenants controls).


this is a great opportunity for engineers that want a comprehensive technical growth as it involves developing skills on three coordinates:

- security: experimenting with access control/packet filtering techniques and kernel modules, managing and monitoring communication among services.

- networking: exploring and implementing solutions at various osi layers and devices, from physical hosts to containers to network switches.

- development: architecting and coding solutions at kernel/hypervisor level, as well as microservices in ooo languages (golang, python, etc.).




designing and implementing networking access management solutions (software or hardware-based) across different technological stacks (physical devices, bare metal os, hypervisors, vms, docker containers) in salesforce's private and public clouds

optimizing access control management from policy declaration to enforcement points (network acls, host and device-based firewalls, etc.)

researching and implementing new networking security solutions and platforms for service communication and access management (intra and inter-clouds, wan)

performing datacenter network architecture security assessments and architecting iaas/paas platforms to harden security and availability posture

developing and managing production services that support network security infrastructure in a full devops model

proven track of building large-scale paas/iaas, leveraging well-known distributed systems technologies (paxos, raft, zookeeper, kafka, rabbitmq, mongodb, etc.)

command over high-availability design, including multi-site routing, peering, and disaster recovery applications and network architectures

devops mindset and full code ownership (design, code, test, deploy, monitor, maintain)

automation/scripting skills for configuration management/monitoring (puppet, bash )

competence in networking programming and debugging
