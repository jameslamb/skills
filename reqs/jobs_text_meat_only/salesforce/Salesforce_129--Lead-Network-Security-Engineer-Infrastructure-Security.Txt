Salesforce 129--Lead-Network-Security-Engineer-Infrastructure-Security.Txt




the security team at salesforce is building a brand new platform for managing inter-service access management. we are looking at a state-of-the-art framework that provides automated translation from user specifications of service access rules to various access control points in our cloud infrastructure where these rules are enforced. this control platform spawns different networking layers (from containers, vms, physical servers and networking devices) as well as technologies (network segmentation, firewalls, hypervisor and tenants controls).  this is a great opportunity for engineers that want a comprehensive technical growth as it involves developing skills on three coordinates: - networking: exploring and implementing solutions at various osi layers and devices, from physical hosts to containers to network switches, from vxlan to bgp   - development: architecting and coding microservices in ooo languages (golang, python, etc). no strings attached, just coding on a clean canvas. - security: experimenting with access control techniques, management and monitoring of communication among services. responsibilities:


designing and implementing networking access management solutions (software or hardware-based) across different technological stacks (physical devices, bare metal os, hypervisors, vms, docker containers) in salesforce's private and public clouds optimizing access control management from policy declaration to enforcement points (network acls, firewalls, iptables, etc.) researching and implementing new networking security solutions and platforms for service communication and access management (intra and inter-clouds, wan) performing datacenter network architecture security assessments and architecting iaas/paas platforms to harden security and availability posture developing and managing production services that support network security infrastructure in a full devops model
8+ years of technical experience, including:
3+ years experience in operating networking or networking security infrastructure 3+ years experience in a high-availability 24x7x365 environment (cloud platforms are a plus)
expertise in osi model and datacenter infrastructure networking (host bootstrap to data lifecycle dhcp, gateway discovery, dns, tcp, ...) hands-on expertise in networking security development, in either or both
hardware: switch acls, stateful firewalls, network segmentation, security zones, etc software: iptables, ipsec, vm/container technologies (openstack neutron, calico), idss, rbacs, vpcs
demonstrated understanding of general unix/linux systems (e.g., centos, rhel, solaris, or similar) proficiency in at least one of the following ooo programming languages: golang, java, c++, python, c#
m.sc/m.eng in computer science/engineering or b.a/b.sc. in same disciplines with equivalent years of experience hands-on expertise in building datacenter (security) networking infrastructure, especially for large cloud paas experience in software-based networking technologies (slb, sdn, vxlan, vpn) experience working with systems from one or more of the following vendors:
hardware: palo alto, fortinet, arista, cisco systems, juniper networks, force 10, f5 networks, gigamon. software: openstack neutron, calico, illumio, vmware overlays
proven track of building large-scale paas or iaas, leveraging well-known distributed systems technologies (paxos, raft, zookeeper, kafka, rabbitmq, mongodb, etc…) strong command over high-availability design, including multi-site routing, peering, and disaster recovery applications and network architectures devops mindset and strong ownership over owned code (test, monitor, deploy, maintain) automation/scripting skill for configuration management/monitoring




  these founding principles have taken our company to great heights, including being named one of forbes's "world's most innovative company” five years in a row and one of fortune's "100 best companies to work for” eight years in a row. we are the fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, and this level of growth equals incredible opportunities to grow a career at salesforce.  li-y*
