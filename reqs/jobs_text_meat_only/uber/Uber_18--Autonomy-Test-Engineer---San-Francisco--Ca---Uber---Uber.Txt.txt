Uber 18--Autonomy-Test-Engineer---San-Francisco--Ca---Uber---Uber.Txt




as an autonomy test engineer, you will be part of a team responsible for analyzing driving events encountered by our vehicles on the road and identifying the underlying reasons for failures. you will manage bugs end-to-end in the process and maintain awareness of new features being released to ensure performance of the software.

review events encountered by the vehicle on the road daily
identify failure modes and assign severity levels to each driving event
manage bugs through their entire lifecycle: filing, maintaining, closing
participate in software discussions and stay on top of all new features
compare on road performance to simulations generated using up-to-date software
generate reports summarizing and communicating software performance
experience working with unix systems and a familiarity working on the command line
basic knowledge of vehicle motion models (braking distance, acceleration profiles, etc)
previous software quality testing experience a plus
able to work in an exciting environment and comfortable with ambiguity
bs degree in technical field or equivalent practical experience


our team of autonomy test engineers on triage and scenario operations work directly with various autonomy teams to ensure the quality and performance of our software, and also with the rest of the simulation teams to ensure we can appropriately reproduce the real world in simulation.
