the general manager is one of the most demanding positions uber has to offer; it requires a unique combination of talent, courage, and leadership. as the leader of uber in each region, the rgm is responsible for the development and sustainable growth of our business and people.

the core of uber is in our cities, working together with country and regional teams, led by a regional general manager. they make the magic that is uber a reality. it's a big deal, and the qualities and capabilities required of an uber rgm mean you are an incredibly intelligent, talented, and highly sought-after professional.

this is first and foremost a role for a strong, analytical marketer, focusing on reaching new users and extending the uber brand in a relevant and thoughtful way across local markets. as the rgm, you'll also be responsible for operational excellence and maintaining and continuously improving â€˜uber' quality throughout the rider's experience, customer support, local marketing, supply chain management, service quality management, social media and pr.
