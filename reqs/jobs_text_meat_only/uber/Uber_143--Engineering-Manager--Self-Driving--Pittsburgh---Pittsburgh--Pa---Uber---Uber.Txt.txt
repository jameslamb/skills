Uber 143--Engineering-Manager--Self-Driving--Pittsburgh---Pittsburgh--Pa---Uber---Uber.Txt





uber atg is seeking an engineering manager to join our team who primarily has impact through organizing the work of others. working at the intersection of technology and people, you will balance long-term direction, health of the team, and individual careers of team members to ensure success in all these dimensions.
access uber's planet-scale data store while gaining subject matter expertise in various parts of the autonomy stack
learn from world-renowned practitioners of robotics, mapping, perception, logistics, machine learning, motion planning, mobile communications, and other fields
see your work deployed fast and often into the real world and stretch yourself as you switch from one tough problem to another
work with an outstanding engineering team and the support of an established data infrastructure
benefit from working at a dynamic startup inside an established, well-capitalized company

people management experience: you have the management playbook to nurture careers, manage under and over-performers, influence cross-functional teams, and recruit and build teams
skills as a full-stack data scientist: equally proficient in software development, statistics, machine learning, big data, and visualization research and product experience
fast learner: we're looking for an engineering manager who thrives on learning new technologies and doesn't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions -- you should be able to adapt easily to meet the needs of our massive growth and rapidly evolving business environment
action: you think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point, and you thrive on the belief that quality doesn't have to be compromised to achieve speed - you can have both at the same time
versatility: in addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance
passion: you feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code "released" until you're sure it's correct; you pride yourself on efficient monitoring, excellent documentation, and proper test coverage
team player mentality: you believe that you can achieve more on a team - that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
design and business acumen: whether you're working on an api used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to details leads to a delightful user experience
