bias toward action. you believe that speed and quality aren't mutually exclusive. you've shown good judgment about shipping as fast as possible while ensuring your products and platforms are built in a sustainable, responsible way--and you're comfortable making mistakes, provided you learn from them.
unquenchable thirst for growth. you're not just looking for the next interesting challenge, but looking to push yourself to keep pace in our high growth environment.

trucks move everything you buy, why shouldn't booking a truck be as seamless as booking an uber?

uber freight connects shippers with carriers / truck drivers, much like the way the uber connects riders and drivers. the uber freight team believes that empowering truck drivers will bring more open, efficient, and increasingly safer transportation to our roads. we are a team of sharp, entrepreneurial individuals who are redefining the movement of goods around the world. we are currently looking for candidates to join our growing team who share our enthusiasm for tackling today's toughest challenges in transportation.
