you're still an amazing designer. your portfolio is so inspiring that we'd consider you for a staff level position, but your interests lie more in helping others become amazing designers.
you know how to set the bar high. uber ships fast. you know what quality looks like and how to help product teams ship at that quality with minimal impact on velocity.
you teach the soft and hard skills. you help designers become the collaborative glue that inspires product management and engineering while also developing their core competencies at envisioning what could be.
you hire excellent people. you're able to create the systems for you (and others) to effectively evaluate and hire designers and researchers who can take uber to new levels of excellence.
you increase the effectiveness of the entire team. you improve the entire design and product teams, not just your direct reports. as a leader and example-setter you should be more effective when you're not even in the room. your processes will be celebrated, emulated and copied by teams throughout the organization.
