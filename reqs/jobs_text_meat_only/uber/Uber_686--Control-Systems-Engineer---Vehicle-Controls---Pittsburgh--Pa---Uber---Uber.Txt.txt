Uber 686--Control-Systems-Engineer---Vehicle-Controls---Pittsburgh--Pa---Uber---Uber.Txt





as a controls systems engineer you will develop and implement real-time functionality for safety-critical embedded applications.

validate in-vehicle controller performance against functional requirements
analyze, sustain, and improve existing controls software.
collaborate with internal and external teams for efficient delivery using standard methodologies

understanding of control theory and experience with its vehicle systems applications
real-time control functionality implementation in c/c++
relevant matlab/simulink tools proficiency
proficiency in languages and tools such as python, vector
industrial experience (automotive preferred)
ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams
flexibility to take on tasks outside of own comfort zone – self starter in a dynamic work environment
engineering degree in a relevant field of study (control systems emphasis preferred)

go-getter - we're looking for team members who flourish by applying their knowledge, learning new technologies and don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions
you should be able to adapt easily to meet the rapid pace of a rapidly evolving research, development, and testing environment.
fearlessness - you think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point
you strive on showing that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time
versatility - in addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance
passion - you feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design "released" until you're confident it's correct
you pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage
a great teammate -  you believe that you can achieve more on a team — that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
you rely on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement
design and eye for business - you understand requirements beyond the written word and how your technical contributions will influence the viability of future products
whether you're working on a software library used by other developers, a sensor to be retrofitted on a test vehicle, or a printed circuit to be mass produced, the other members of the team can depend on the quality of your work to rapidly advance our goals


at the advanced technologies group (atg), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. our teams in pittsburgh, san francisco, phoenix, and toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.

the controls systems team strives to achieve the perfect harmony between software and hardware through efficient solutions to complex problems related to self driving, including controls theory, simulations and vehicle systems.
