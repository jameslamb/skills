Uber 101--Fullstack-Software-Engineer-(Vilnius)---Vilnius--Lithuania---Uber---Uber.Txt





the
observability vilnius
team is part of the observability group within uber infrastructure. we are charged with delivering platforms in two specific domains at uber: on-call experience and host-level monitoring. our team works with the rest of the observability group to build the tools to monitor physical infrastructure at uber and build Â applications that our engineers across uber use to ensure on-call & incident response processes are running properly.


the
observability vilnius
team works on a few end-to-end systems and tools for supporting on-call engineers on their duties, monitoring, alerting and generally making sense of millions of hosts checks that are monitored at uber.

as part of our team you'll work on the full-stack of these applications along with a few other front-end, backend-end and full-stack engineers. some of the work you'd be involved in includes:

building a platform for on-call, incident response and incident review processes management.
building an open-source platform for host-level monitoring.
prototyping new features to make the lives our engineers at uber easier.
putting the new features that work into production and ditching the ones that don't.

you'll generally help build out some of our existing tools, as well as craft new ones. we aspire to make most of our work open source, and prefer like minded team members who understand the balance of building software for use inside of uber that also has a path for external use via open source.


generally, you'll do well on our team and enjoy the kind of projects we work on if you:
as a full stack engineer, you will work closely with other teams to develop tools specific to their needs. from database schema design decisions to backend services to tweaking css, you will have a hand in all levels of the software stack.
good programming skills in at least one of go, java, c/c++, python, .net, php and an ability to pick up new ones.
expert level linux knowledge and a good understanding of its fundamentals and internals: kernel, filesystems, modern memory management, threads and processes, the user/kernel-space divide, network stack, etc.
a good understanding of large-scale distributed systems in practice, including multi-tier architectures, application security, monitoring and storage systems.
experience with aws, gcp or azure.
configuration management knowledge: puppet, chef, etc.
good scripting skills of at least one of bash, perl, etc.
caching and queuing technologies knowledge.
working knowledge of the tcp/ip stack, internet routing and load balancing.
