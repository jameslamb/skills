Uber 111--Localization-And-Mapping-Engineer---Pittsburgh--Pa---Uber---Uber.Txt





we're looking for talented engineers to help develop the next generation localization and mapping systems for uber's fleet of self-driving vehicles. we are a group of diverse researchers, engineers, and computer scientists. if you have experience working on solutions for lidar or image-based registration, simultaneous localization and mapping (slam), nonlinear optimization, and/or large-scale mapping systems, we want to hear from you.
design, implement, test, and maintain real-time localization and mapping software that runs on self-driving uber
vehicles
design, implement, test, and maintain localization and mapping software that runs offboard for optimization, analysis, testing, and verification
analyze large datasets and work with raw sensor data
collaborate cross-functionally with other engineering teams at uber and communicate your work to colleagues and management
highly skilled in lidar point cloud registration, or geometric computer vision, or state estimation
extensive, demonstrable results in real-world applications
good experience developing software in c++
shown ability to produce computationally intensive software that runs and produces high-quality results in real-time
solid understanding of 3d spatial mathematics concepts
prior experience in any of pose estimation, probabilistic filtering, slam, nonlinear optimization, autonomy, networking, or user interfaces desired
experience with techniques or applications for nonlinear optimization (e.g., nonlinear least squares, bundle adjustment, pose graph optimization)
python development experience
experience in state estimation using kalman filters
minimum 3 years of industry experience


at the advanced technologies group (atg), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. our teams in pittsburgh, san francisco, phoenix, and toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.

we are a group of diverse researchers, engineers, and computer scientists working to develop accurate localization and mapping systems for self-driving vehicles. reliability and scalability are key drivers for us as our software must perform across a large fleet of vehicles in large and diverse operating areas.
