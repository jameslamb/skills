Uber 32--Localization-Engineer---San-Francisco--Ca---Uber---Uber.Txt






this an opportunity for those withÂ specializations in developing new real-time registration, localization and pose estimation algorithms from a variety of sensor and inertial data, and/or production-quality software development.
design, implement, test, and maintain real-time localization and mapping software that runs on self-driving uber vehicles
design, implement, test, and maintain localization and mapping software that runs offboard for optimization, analysis, testing, and verification
analyze large datasets and work with raw sensor data
collaborate cross-functionally with other engineering teams at uber and communicate your work to colleagues and management

highly skilled in probabilistic filtering theory, or geometric computer vision, or inertial pose theory
extensive, demonstrable results in real-world applications
good experience and experience programming in c++. python skills are also desirable but not essential.
shown ability to produce computationally intensive software that runs and produces high quality results in real time
prior experience in any of pose estimation, probabilistic filtering, slam, nonlinear optimization, autonomy, networking, or user interfaces desired


at the advanced technologies group (atg), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. our teams in pittsburgh, san francisco, phoenix, and toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.
