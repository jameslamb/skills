fast

learner

fearlessness
. you think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point. you strive on showing that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time.
versatility
. in addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance.
passion
. you feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design "released" until you're confident it's correct. you pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage.
a

team

player

design

and

business

acumen
