as a machine learning engineer you will be designing and building machine learning features for self-driving cars and improving its perception, prediction, tracking, and motion planning capabilities. this is your chance to develop cutting-edge technology that will help change the future of transportation around the world!
applied machine learning e.g., supervised methods like logistic regression, svms, random forests, deep learning & reinforcement learning and also semi-supervised & active learning approaches that leverage a human in the loop
working with big data, processing millions of samples and billions of features for modeling
building and owning production models, pipelines, and runtimes
crowdsourcing and machine teaching technologies like crowdflower and mturk
a bs in computer science or related field
a strong quantitative background
excellent software development skills in one or more of c, c++, java, or python
excellent presentation and communication skills
minimum 2 years of experience in software design and development for shipping machine learning features in products
experience with hadoop, pig, or other mapreduce paradigms
experience in designing and building infrastructure and web services at large scale
track record of building and shipping machine learning features in products
prior work in automotive applications

at the advanced technologies group (atg), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. our teams in pittsburgh, san francisco, phoenix, and toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.

we are passionate about designing machine learning algorithms and applying them to solve real-world problems.Â in addition to machine learning, we love building end to end applications that span the whole engineering stack: the frontend that drives the user experience, the application mid-tier, and the machine learning backends that crunch large amounts of data. we are driven by our desire to use machine learning to help make self-driving cars a reality.
