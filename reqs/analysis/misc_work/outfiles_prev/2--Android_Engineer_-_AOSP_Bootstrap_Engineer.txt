Android Engineer - AOSP Bootstrap Engineer

About Uber 
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
About the Role
In this role you will contribute to the creation, development and maintenance of the Android OS on custom-build hardware for use in Uber’s self-driving vehicles. This work is critical to Uber achieving scale with a self-driving fleet. This hardware, and the software built on top of it, will play a critical role in shaping the customer experience of riding in a self-driving car.
