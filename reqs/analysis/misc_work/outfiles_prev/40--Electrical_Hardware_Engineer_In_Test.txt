Electrical Hardware Engineer In Test

About Uber
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
About the Role
 
As a hardware test engineer on the V&V team, you will participate in the engineering process from start to finish: Determine engineering requirements, develop hardware test plans, develop test cases, design/build test fixtures, execute tests and document/analyze results to validate components and systems.
