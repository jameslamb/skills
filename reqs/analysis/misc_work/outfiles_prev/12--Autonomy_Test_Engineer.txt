Autonomy Test Engineer

About Uber
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
About the Role
As an Autonomy Test Engineer, you will be part of a team responsible for analyzing driving events encountered by our vehicles on the road, identifying the underlying reasons for failures, and designing the scenarios that will simulate behavior of our vehicles and surrounding actors. You will be interpreting results and understanding areas of improvement to make autonomous technology ready for the road. You will support other ATG efforts with clear and concise data that provides unambiguous feedback so autonomy engineering and technical leaders make the right choices. You will maintain awareness of new features and define the processes and mechanisms to verify performance of all relevant scenarios before the software releases.

About the Team
At the Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. Our teams in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. Our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.
 
Our team of Autonomy Test Engineers on Triage and Scenario Operations works directly with various autonomy teams to ensure the quality and performance of our software, and also with the rest of the Simulation teams to ensure we can appropriately reproduce the real world in simulation.
