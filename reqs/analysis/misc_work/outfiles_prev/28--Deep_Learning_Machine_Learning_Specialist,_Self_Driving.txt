Deep Learning/Machine Learning Specialist, Self Driving

About Uber
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
About the Role
 
Do you you have a passion for science and engineering? Then you should apply to join our engineering team taking on machine learning challenges in the area of self-driving vehicles. You will take your ideas from conception to implementation and testing and then deploy your work on real systems and see how they perform in real-world conditions.
