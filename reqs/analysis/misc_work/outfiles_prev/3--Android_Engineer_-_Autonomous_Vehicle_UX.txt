Android Engineer - Autonomous Vehicle UX

About Uber 
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
About the Role
 
In this role you will contribute to the design, development and maintenance of the user interfaces in Uber self-driving vehicles based on Android. This work is critical to Uber achieving scale with a self-driving fleet. These interfaces will play a critical role in many development activities as well as in the completion of rides for normal Uber riders.
