Control Systems Engineer - Vehicle Controls

About Uber
 
We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 
And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

Go-getter - We’re looking for team members who flourish by applying their knowledge, learning new technologies and don’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions
You should be able to adapt easily to meet the rapid pace of a rapidly evolving research, development, and testing environment.
Fearlessness - You think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point
You strive on showing that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time
Versatility - In addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance
Passion - You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design "released" until you’re confident it’s correct
You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage
A great teammate -  You believe that you can achieve more on a team — that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
You rely on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement
Design and eye for business - You understand requirements beyond the written word and how your technical contributions will influence the viability of future products
Whether you’re working on a software library used by other developers, a sensor to be retrofitted on a test vehicle, or a printed circuit to be mass produced, the other members of the team can depend on the quality of your work to rapidly advance our goals
