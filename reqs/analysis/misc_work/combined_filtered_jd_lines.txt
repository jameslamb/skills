Software Engineer, Continuous Integration Infrastructure and Developer Environments
The CI + DevEnv team serves a dual mission at Square. We strive to provide an exceptional continuous integration pipeline for Square engineers. Secondly, we provide pop up staging environments for personalized use.
We are looking for a new team member to help us make these services best in class. Here are a couple projects we have coming up soon that you could help us with:
1. We want to completely eliminate queue time from our CI system. We already use AWS heavily but by switching to containers we can have near infinite capacity to run tests as soon as a commit is pushed to git. We will either use the Elastic Container Service in AWS to accomplish this or switch to Google Cloud.
2. Square is a big practitioner of the service-oriented architecture model of software development. Our production ecosystem consists of a vast array of interdependent services. Design and implement a solution to lower the friction of developing in a service-oriented architecture through the use of cloud computing and container technologies like Docker. With the goal of making development in a SOA-environment an efficient and pleasant experience.
Engineers on our team should feel at home working in and around a broad swath of technologies, and understanding the day-to-day frictions of development work your colleagues face. You'll be working with Engineers across the company to eliminate bottlenecks and develop complementary solutions that allow developers to move faster. You enjoy building new systems from the ground up as much as you love tweaking existing systems to achieve maximum performance.
The team regularly works with open source projects and tools and we contribute back as well. Our main CI application, Kochiku, was built in-house and open sourced. Check out Square's full list of open source projects at http://square.github.io/.

The Developer Platform team has grown rapidly, and we've been so fortunate to keep adding great teammates to the 'family.'
We went from 5 to 30+ people in the last ~18 months. Here ares quotes directly from your future teammates:
Culture:
"I was looking for a company where the aim is to collaborate and empower each other. Square has that on its DNA and also on its business model. As long as merchants and developers sell more and do better, Square does well. So it's a win-win setting that translates in the way teams and people work together."
Learning opportunities:
"After asking on several interviews how was knowledge shared across team members and teams I found out that the openness and size of Square would allow me to learn more and have an open mind to digging into different technologies and languages. Great big companies also have this but they are so massive that's easy to get lost."
Career growth and balance:
"I also consider the size of the company a great one for me to grow professionally on my career without sacrificing my other goals in life. Work life balance is a big deal for me too."
People: "
Square was the place where I felt treated the best (compared to my other interviews). I am not talking about what things you can do / swag / lunch or other goodies you can get. I'm referring to the way I was welcomed, listened to, questions answered, and even they way I was escorted out the day I interviewed, and my follow ups with the recruiter and you [, my hiring manager]."
We want you to join too:
"If this excites you well then please apply, or tell a friend and invite them to apply!"

Longer term, we’re optimistic that smartphone apps like Uber can also offer a real alternative to individual car ownership.  After all, if you can press a button and get an affordable ride across town in minutes 24-hours a day, why bother to own a car?  There is an alternative to a world that looks like a parking lot and moves like a traffic jam. Join Uber to help make that future possible.

About Public Policy at Uber
Our public policy team is responsible for working with policy makers and third parties to make the positive case for Uber. That’s partly about building lasting relationships in the cities where we operate with politicians and their staff so they understand the benefits of ridesharing. It also about figuring out the best local regulatory framework and then developing campaigns to push reform through.
We are looking for someone to lead our Government Affairs & Public Policy in Northern Europe, based in London.
Ideally you would have 8+ years experience in government affairs, but we’re open to people in other walks of life (e.g. the law, media, consultancy) that intuitively get this stuff and may be looking for a career change.  Fluency in English, both oral and written, is essential.
Building an effective, credible government affairs team across the region;
Establishing Uber’s brand and profile with policy makers:;including governments, third parties and academics; and
Working to ensure that the regulatory framework in every country supports ridesharing apps like Uber.
Representing the business externally with speaking events, select committees and in the media.
A self starter:  Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up.  Stuff changes fast in our world so you’ll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure.
A great advocate:  We’re looking to create new regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and alternatives to individual car ownership.  You’ll need the intellectual fire power to grasp complex policy issues as well as the ability to articulate clearly and simply how apps like Uber can help improve transportation for everyone—both orally and in writing.
A strong campaigner:  Smartphone apps are disruptive, and the interests being disrupted are deeply entrenched.  So you’ll need to put together proactive campaigns involving passengers, drivers and third parties that demonstrate there’s a better alternative to today’s outdated status quo.  That means having a bias for action in everything you do—and a willingness to engage in debates, that can often become heated.
A team player:  Success at Uber depends on the ability to organize different teams (internally and externally) around shared goals.  It’s why we’re looking for well organized people who enjoy working with others to get stuff done—and who can deal with the ambiguity that sometimes comes from working cross-functionally.

Technical Outbound Sourcer - Contract
Uber started out to solve a simple problem:  the need to get a ride across town.  Six years and one billion trips later, we’ve stumbled upon something a bit bigger:  a new way to help tackle congestion—one of the most serious challenges cities face today.
Using technology, Uber makes it quick and easy for people headed in the same direction at the same time to share their journey.  It’s carpooling at the press of a button.  And by getting more people into fewer cars we’ve proven you can reduce congestion and pollution overtime. UberPOOL in Los Angeles, for example, cut the number of kilometres driven across town by 12.7 million and carbon dioxide pollution by 1,400 metric in just eight months in Los Angeles.
Longer term, we’re optimistic that smartphone apps like Uber can also offer a real alternative to individual car ownership.  After all, if you can press a button and get an affordable ride across town in minutes 24-hours a day, why bother to own a car?  There is an alternative to a world that looks like a parking lot and moves like a traffic jam.  Join Uber to help make that future possible.
We need help building our teams on a national level. If you're ready to work hard, sourcing and hiring top talent worldwide, this may be the gig for you.
Still reading? The right person will be comfortable in an "all hands on deck" environment, loves solving people problems and can thrive in a startup culture. This role is all about bringing on the smartest folks, maintaining our culture as we grow crazy fast and putting process in place to keep it moving.

Copywriter/Content Specialist
Uber has already made more than 300 cities around the world better places to live and work by providing superior transportation choices and greater economic opportunity. But this is just the beginning, and we’re looking for top content strategy and copywriting talent to craft the communications that help us reach the next level.
If you have the right stuff to join our Content team, you’ll work among other exceptionally talented staff in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, highly collaborative environment. From product launches to marketing promotions, you will have the opportunity to give a local voice to Uber’s communications.
We are deeply user-centric and believe we can innovate our way past any roadblock. The challenges we tackle require thorough experimentation and execution, bold ideas, obsession with pursuing perfection, fearlessness and optimism in the face of uncertainty, creative problem-solving, and tenacity in taking projects to the finish line.
We might be a good match if...
The details matter to you.
You know every word must do work, and that writing great copy demands great care with every choice. You are just as committed to crafting impressive error messages and navigation labels as you are to brainstorming splashy headlines and big creative concepts. You understand the nuanced implications — sounds, connotations, tone, cadence — of synonyms and syntax, and your itch for elegant language pushes you to polish every line until it shines.
Your writing means business.
You appreciate the art of excellent copy, but you know it’s not about creating fine art. You create communications to inform and improve user experiences, but more importantly to persuade and elicit specific actions. Your approach is rooted in bottom-line thinking, using analytics to guide creative decisions and support arguments. You value achieving business objectives over accruing portfolio pieces.
You iterate quickly and respect deadlines.
When it’s time to get locked in, you know how to move fast while still being meticulous and conscientious in your work. You know a first draft is never a final draft, so you work through multiple rounds efficiently — thinking all the way through the experience, developing a solid foundation, tinkering, collecting feedback, and refining. You do whatever it takes to keep projects on track while keeping messaging on target.
You dig deep and you go broad.
Exploration is inherent in your process. You devour research to become a subject matter expert, then you come up with a range of concepts for even a single banner ad (and everything else you work on). You think through all the strengths and weaknesses of a communication strategy, and have thoughtful answers to every question. If you’re presenting five headline options, you write at least fifty. There’s strong rationale behind every recommendation you make, because you tried it a million other ways. Even when you think you have the solution right away, you try honestly to prove yourself wrong.
You are equal parts content strategist and copywriter.
Clever phrases and creative concepts aren’t all you care about. You’re passionate about developing sound strategy, determining message hierarchies, and developing user experiences that communicate exactly the right message to the right person at the right time. You don’t sacrifice clarity or simplicity to protect your own precious gems.
You fight the good fight, and you fight fair.
Selling your work and ideas is one of your most impressive skills. You defend your decisions and push for what you think is right for the business objectives and audience needs, using logic and evidence rather than opinion or emotion to make your case. You do this all with a collaborative spirit that puts the good of the team ahead of your own ego — listening closely to other viewpoints and sincerely considering all feedback, then picking your battles wisely and employing storytelling techniques to win people over.
Your marketing copy gets attention and elicits action.
Compelling, memorable marketing and ad copy is your superpower. You bridge the gap between what a brand wants to say and what the audience wants to hear. You’re skilled at translating features into benefits, crafting messages with emotional resonance, and figuring out how to make them stick. Your copy stands out without being sensationalist, clearly communicates the key points, and drives toward the desired result with an irresistible CTA — all while maintaining the brand voice.
You know the words have to look (and feel) right.
Great copy is a key ingredient of great design, and your work shows how you’ve tailored messages to fit certain spaces, styles, and systems. You recognize that a first draft in a Word doc is just a starting point, and that it rarely survives contact with a design comp — even when you start with character counts. You know when breaking grammar and punctuation rules is the right thing to do for a design solution, and can back it up.
You know the medium matters.
When you write content, you think about how it will be consumed. You understand how desktop vs. mobile, print vs. digital, and push vs. pull affects the way people read and retain information. You’re skilled at telling the same story across multiple channels in a way that’s integrated yet optimized for every touchpoint.

Airspace Systems - Senior Software Engineer - Uber Elevate
The candidate will report to the Director of Engineering, Airspace Systems (Tom Prevot). The candidate will also work closely with the Airspace Systems Design and Validation Team and the Network Operations Center Engineering Team, once these are established.
Within Advanced Programs, the candidate will need to coordinate with the Operations Planning team, the Data Science team, and the Design team for Advanced Programs. The candidate will also coordinate closely with the other engineering teams in Dispatch/Marketplace/Security at Uber, and potentially external stakeholders (e.g. NASA, FAA).
Technical depth in engineering an operational capability
The candidate needs to possess the skillset to design and implement the ENS to support large scale aerial rideshare operations, as well as drone deliveries. Therefore, the candidate should have extensive experience in scalable systems and creating production systems (such as Uber Dispatch).
This candidate will be expected to be an individual contributor, and s/he will directly contribute code for the initial systems.
The ENS will require near-real-time processing of large amounts of data across many devices. The candidate should have extensive experience building engineering back-ends, service-oriented architectures, and efficient data distribution services.
The ENS will support large-scale, safe airspace operations. The candidate will work closely with the Director of Airspace Systems (Tom Prevot) to implement the requirements associated with achieving the required high level of safety in airspace operations. Ideally the candidate also has background enabling and measuring safe operations.
The front end to the ENS will become the blueprint for an initial Network Operations Center. The candidate will need to be able to work an initial capability in a budget constraint environment while maintaining the vision for the actual long term capability that will be needed.
Additionally, the candidate will need to work closely with highly-technical aviation companies and other parts of the ecosystem in a highly detail-oriented and technical capacity. As such, s/he must have a strong ability to grasp complex technical concepts and engage with highly-technical business partners to direct design and manufacturing efforts, as necessary.
The candidate has experience in top engineering teams (ideally at Uber or another large tech company) and has extremely high regard for building to optimize safety and efficiency on a tightly-managed budget.
The candidate ideally has experience working with software assurance methods.
Strong vision and strategic thinking
Given the zero-to-one nature of Elevate (and thus the airspace systems within Elevate), the candidate will need to be able to envision the potential full scale of airspace operations supported and be able to lay out a framework that will support effective development and large scale operations.
Uber may be the first company to implement airspace services for eVTOLs, but we are behind our competition in implementing small UAS services. The candidate will need to be able to quickly respond to changing priorities and change the development pace of certain services if priorities change.
It is imperative that this individual can go beyond merely executing on projects and instead contribute new ideas and challenge the status quo when appropriate.
It is equally important that the candidate does not attempt to boil the ocean, i.e. try to build too much at one time.  S/he must be a “practical visionary” who can see the end game and execute a course to get there with many deliverables and key progress milestones along the way.
Team building and engineering management skills
An important part of this job will be to work with the Director, Airspace Systems (Tom Prevot) to establish an extremely effective engineering team that can initially work as a small, highly-efficient team, but over time will become a much larger team that will be responsible for creating a large-scale, mission-critical software system. The candidate should possess the skills to grow into a leadership position that can  form and motivate a team at the different stages of growth.
The candidate will need to work with the Operations Planning team and the Data Science team to effectively prioritize the software implementation to meet the most important upcoming milestones. Therefore the candidate will need to be able to assess the scope of the work, prioritize, and push back on low priority items.
The candidate may also need to navigate a complex set of partners including FAA, NASA, and other industry partners, as well as competitors who will share the airspace.
S/he must understand the needs of the core business and find ways to bring value to it through the efforts on AP initiatives.

Production Designer, Platform
Uber is a technology company that is changing the way the world thinks about transportation. We are building technology people use everyday. Whether it's heading home from work, getting a meal delivered from a favorite restaurant, or a way to earn extra income, Uber is becoming part of the fabric of daily life.
We're making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. And we're doing it at a global scale-energizing local economies and bringing opportunity to millions of people around the world.
Uber's positive impact is tangible in the communities we operate in, and that drives us to keep moving forward.
Uber is seeking designers experienced in systems design to join our team. Come shape and invent ways to scale the design ecosystem at Uber.
The Design Platform team is looking for a team-member with significant experience designing systems - someone who is a systems thinker at heart, is equally amazing in interaction design, visual design, and prototyping, and has experience establishing and evolving design patterns at scale. In this role you will be working collaboratively with Product Management, Design, and Engineering teams to execute designs that will inform the global design system by which our various web apps are designed and built on.
You are an excellent communicator, comfortable in a fast-paced, growing environment, and passionate about scaling design systems to achieve consistent, high-quality experiences while developing the Uber digital brand. This position is full-time and based in San Francisco. The role requires great execution, bold innovation, passion for quality, and optimism to be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the user in mind and aspiration to take projects to the finish line.
What you'll need
To be a champion of consistency, quality, and efficiency. You understand the benefits of recycling design patterns but know when it's time to improve their design for broader use cases, effectiveness or consistency with the system at large.
To have shipped product. You've weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, how to motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right, how to translate insights from user studies into meaningful action, and what's most likely to go afoul at each stage. You can share several shining examples of real work you've shipped, and what you learned along the way.
Speed, resourcefulness, and go-getter attitude. You are a self starter and able to lean in when necessary to push a project over the finish line. You come up with creative solutions to completing projects in less-than-ideal situations. A lack of resources doesn't stop you. You enjoy the opportunity of finding ways to get it done.
Prototyping as a key part of your toolset. You've prototyped on multiple platforms. You've made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.
You believe in craftsmanship and create elegant and compelling designs, over and over. Your portfolio is eye-wateringly beautiful. You have deep knowledge of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better. Your standards are very high, and you constantly strive to elevate your abilities.
Technical abilities. You don't necessarily have to be able to build your own web app but you're fluent in the technologies needed to create the framework. Bonus points if you're savvy in HTML/CSS.
Cross-platform skills. You've shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn't, or why you'd opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android. While this role is mobile-specific, you'll be designing for a system with touchpoints across all platforms, and understanding the nuances of each is important.

Design Manager, Products
We're seeking an excellent design leader to manage and help designers and researchers on our product team realize Uber's global vision, and together, become the best design team in the industry.
What you'll need
#LI-POST
You're still an amazing designer. Your portfolio is so inspiring that we'd consider you for a staff level position, but your interests lie more in helping others become amazing designers.
You know how to set the bar high. Uber ships fast. You know what quality looks like and how to help product teams ship at that quality with minimal impact on velocity.
You teach the soft and hard skills. You help designers become the collaborative glue that inspires product management and engineering while also developing their core competencies at envisioning what could be.
You hire excellent people. You're able to create the systems for you (and others) to effectively evaluate and hire designers and researchers who can take Uber to new levels of excellence.
You increase the effectiveness of the entire team. You improve the entire design and product teams, not just your direct reports. As a leader and example-setter you should be more effective when you're not even in the room. Your processes will be celebrated, emulated and copied by teams throughout the organization.
Design Manager, Marketplace
The Marketplace Dynamics group creates the platform, products, and algorithms responsible for the real time execution and online optimization of Uber's marketplace. We are creating the brain of Uber, solving NP-hard algorithms and economic optimization problems at scale, in real time, making all of the decisions for Uber's marketplaces based on up-to-the-second data as well as forecasts of the future. And we're not just talking about designing algorithms - we also develop extensive production systems to fuel these algorithms from the ground up.
Our group's systems control the dynamics of all of Uber's markets, from our core personal transport business with UberX and UberPool, to Uber's emerging markets such as UberEATS and UberRUSH. We focus on areas like dynamic pricing (surge pricing, upfront pricing), intelligent dispatching (matching algorithms, dispatch paradigms), and supply positioning (optimal positioning of drivers in anticipation of demand patterns). The goal of these systems is to dramatically lower cost & ETAs for riders, increase revenue for driver partners, improve the overall efficiency and utilization of Uber's fleet of supply, and enable products in entirely new marketplaces.
Our group is continuously deploying a variety of system configuration and algorithmic changes that affect how we respond to and attempt to balance supply and demand in different markets - any given week could involve deploying a new real time dynamic pricing algorithm, testing a set of new dispatching features, and launching a supply positioning recommendation system to drivers. In addition to all of the changes that the teams in the Marketplace Dynamics group are constantly making in order to optimize Uber's marketplace, there are scores of other changes external to our control happening in each city's markets: rider growth, driver growth, trip growth, cyclical daily/weekly demand patterns, special events, weather, and even Uber promotions like Kittens and Ice Cream.
We're seeking a world-class design leader to guide and help designers and researchers on our product team realize Uber's global vision, and together, become the best design team in the industry.
What you'll need
You are an amazing hands on designer and mentor: Your portfolio is so inspiring that we'd consider you for a staff level position, but your interests lie more in helping others become amazing designers.
You know how to set the bar high: Uber ships fast. You know what quality looks like and how to help product teams ship at that quality with minimal effects on velocity.
You teach the hard and the soft skills: You help designers become the collaborative glue that inspires product management and engineering while also developing their core competencies at envisioning what could be.
You hire world-class professionals: Your network gets a slow clap from recruiters. You're able to create the systems for you (and others) to effectively evaluate and hire designers and researchers who can take Uber to new levels of excellence.
You catalyze initiative across the whole team: You improve the entire design and product teams, not just your direct reports. As a leader and example-setter you should be more effective when you're not even in the room. Your processes will be celebrated, emulated and copied by teams throughout the organization.

You’ll collaborate with engineers, product managers, designers, researchers, and some of the world’s best copywriters and content strategists in a fast-paced, rapidly growing environment—to make magical experiences for people around the world.
We’re hiring at all levels to help us build out our premier product design team. Uber has already made more than 310 cities around the world better places to live and work by providing superior transportation choices and greater economic opportunity, but this is just the beginning. We’re looking for superb copywriting and content strategists to craft the in-app messaging that help will help our products and brand reach the next level.
The details matter to you
You know every word is important, and that great copy demands great care. You are just as committed to crafting impressive error messages and navigation labels as you are to brainstorming new features and big creative concepts. You understand the nuances of tone, voice, syntax, systematic thinking, and structure, and you polish every line until it shines.
Your writing means business
You create communications to inform and improve user experiences, but more importantly to elicit specific actions that achieve business goals. Your approach is rooted in bottom-line thinking, using analytics to guide creative decisions and support arguments. You can use research and data to help bolster your creative decisions.
You iterate quickly and respect deadlines
When it's time to get locked in, you know how to move quickly while still being meticulous and conscientious in your work. You work through multiple rounds efficiently. And you think all the way through the experience, developing a solid foundation, tinkering, collecting feedback, and refining. You are committed to keeping projects on track while keeping messaging on target.
You dig deep and go broad
Exploration is inherent in your process. You devour research to become a subject matter expert, then you come up with a range of concepts for every initiative. You think through all the strengths and weaknesses of a communication strategy, and have thoughtful answers to every question. If you're presenting five options for a messaging strategy, headline, or microinteraction, you write fifty.
You're equal parts content strategist and copywriter
Clever phrases and creative concepts aren't all you care about. You’re passionate about developing sound strategies, determining messaging hierarchies, and developing user experiences that communicate exactly the right notion to the right person at the right time.
You present your work with confidence
Selling your ideas is one of your most impressive skills. You defend what you think is right for the business goals and audience needs, relying on logic and evidence rather than opinion or emotion. With a collaborative spirit that puts the good of the team ahead of your own ego, you listen closely to other viewpoints and consider all feedback. And you use your point of view and the opinions of others to develop narratives that convince people of why you believe in your decisions.
You're skilled in product and UX/UI content
The way you've wielded language for product experiences has made them more intuitive, useful, and delightful. You've created great user-focused nomenclature for navigation systems, clear headings and CTAs that simplify task flows, and memorable microcopy that gets tweeted about. You've weathered release cycles and can share several shining examples of real work you've shipped, describing what you learned along the way.
You know the medium matters
When you write content, you think about how it will be consumed. You understand how desktop vs. mobile, print vs. digital, and push vs. pull affects the way people read and retain information. You're skilled at telling the same story across multiple channels in a way that's integrated, yet optimized for every touchpoint.

You’re primarily digital with some analog tendencies.
You push the limits of a responsive layout and can pack a punch into a 30k ad banner. You love the emotional impact added by interactions, transitions, and animations, but you’re not afraid of a little CMYK. Your skills are built on a foundation of classical graphic design.
You are a storyteller.
You understand that the key to great communication design is great communication. You use stories to make your work compelling, relevant, and meaningful to your audience.

You are incredibly productive.
You deliver twice the quality in half the time. You mastered the Creative Suite years ago. You geek out on keyboard shortcuts, Photoshop actions, and the newest prototyping tools. You constantly strive to optimize your workflow, increase your output, and become a more efficient and effective designer.
You can think and talk about the bottom line.
Analytics don’t scare you, and you know which features can act as force multipliers on your company’s business model. You translate business strategies into compelling experiences for real people.
Cross-platform is your style.
Hopefully you’ve designed for several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn’t, when to design in RGB vs CMYK and when to refer to a Pantone book.

Strong conceptual thinker
Proven ability to deliver exceptional design at high volumes under tight timelines
7+ years of visual design experience
Ability to elevate our brand and establish a high bar for design quality
