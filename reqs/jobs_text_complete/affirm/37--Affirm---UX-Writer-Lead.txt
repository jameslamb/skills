 Everyone deserves to live life fully. But when it comes down to it, our financial partners are usually more of a hindrance than a help. Affirm’s goal is to give people more opportunities to lead a prosperous life—without asking them to sign away their future in hidden fees and endless debt. A big part of this mission is being the easiest-to-use and most customer-friendly financial option out there.
 The UX writer lead will report to our copy lead, and will work with a high degree of independence, collaborating on a daily basis with our awesome product designers, product managers, engineers, and user researchers.

 There will also be some flexibility to focus on areas of interest and to work on projects outside of UX if you’d like.
