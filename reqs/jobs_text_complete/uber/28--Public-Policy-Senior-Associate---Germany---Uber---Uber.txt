 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 Our public policy team is responsible for working with policy makers and third parties to make the positive case for Uber.  That’s partly about building lasting relationships in the cities where we operate with politicians and their staff so they understand the benefits of ridesharing.  It also about figuring out the best local regulatory framework and then developing campaigns to push reform through.
  
 We are looking for someone to work on our Government Affairs & Policy team in Germany, ideally based in Berlin or Munich.  You will report directly to our Head of Public Policy for DACH & CEE.  
 What You’ll Do
  
 Supporting Uber’s Government Affairs & Policy team in Germany;
 Establishing Uber’s brand and profile with policy makers
 —including federal and state governments, third parties and academics
 ; and
 Working to ensure that the regulatory framework in Germany supports digital business models.
  Public speaking engagements and frequent travelling across Germany
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 A self starter
 :  Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up.  Stuff changes fast in our world so you’ll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure.  
 A great advocate
 :  
 We’re looking to create new regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and alternatives to individual car ownership.  You’ll need the intellectual fire power to grasp complex policy issues as well as the ability to articulate clearly and simply how apps like Uber can help improve transportation for everyone
 —both orally and in writing
 .  
 A strong campaigner
 :  Smartphone apps are disruptive, and the interests being disrupted are deeply entrenched.  So you’ll need to put together proactive campaigns involving passengers, drivers and third parties that demonstrate there’s a better alternative to today’s outdated status quo.  That means having a bias for action in everything you do—and a willingness to engage in debates, that can often become heated.
 A skilled writer
 : Uber's policy agenda is simple-advance public policy that benefits riders, drivers, and cities. You'll need to creatively condense the thorniest policy arguments and research into language simple enough for anyone to understand.
 A team player:
   Success at Uber depends on the ability to organize different teams (internally and externally) around shared goals.  It’s why we’re looking for well organized people who enjoy working with others to get stuff done—and who can deal with the ambiguity that sometimes comes from working cross-functionally.  
  
 Ideally you would have 5+ years in government affairs, but we’re open to more  applicants and people in other walks of life (e.g. the law, media, consultancy) that intuitively get this stuff and may be looking for a career change.
