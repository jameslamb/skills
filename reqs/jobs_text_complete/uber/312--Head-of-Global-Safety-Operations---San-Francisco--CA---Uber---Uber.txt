 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

 Safety is a critical issue that resonates everywhere Uber operates. It’s crucial for our users, our business, and our brand. 
 In this role, you will lead our global Safety Operations efforts to ensure that Uber’s regional processes and products set the global standard for transport safety and transparency.
  As the Head of Global Safety Operations, you will build strong relationships with Product and Operations leadership around the world. You and your organization will work with these two key orgs and will be accountable for driving safety incident reduction, guiding business priorities to create safer experiences for our users, and building public trust in the safety of our platform.

 Leverage local insights and global best practices to create Uber's safety roadmap across the company and guide various teams through its implementation
 Drive centralization across Safety systems, processes, and tech in order to drive efficiency and effectiveness of safety programs
 Establish a culture of “safety first” and “doing the right thing” within Uber Operations, even when not popular, by setting the right tone from the top
