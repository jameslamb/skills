 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
 As a Summer of 2018 Uber intern, you will get the chance to learn how we’re making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. With the opportunity to immerse yourself in projects with real world impact, your work will be visible and meaningful. From building solutions to increase driver-partner supply hours with City Operations, or analysing data and metrics in order to revolutionize how we support our community with Community Operations, you will get to be an integral of our various teams based in Singapore.
 This is a 12-week summer internship program based in Singapore. 
 Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning in November 2017. Team and project will be allocated based on your skill set and experience, with consideration for your preference.
 The final application submission deadline is January 30th, 2018 at 11:59pm SGT, but applicants are strongly encouraged to apply before this date.
