 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role:
  
 Our UX Research Team is seeking summer 2018 research interns to help us develop innovative new products and services. The work is fascinating. You’ll work among best-in-class design researchers, designers, product managers, and design-oriented engineers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.
  
 What You’ll Do:
  
  
 Define quantitative and/or qualitative UX research questions in collaboration with Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Project Managers.
 Examine existing insights and product designs to generate hypotheses and plan high-impact research.
 Prioritize and drive research to improve the user experience.
 Communicate findings to stakeholders on the team. Make research findings convincing and actionable for both research experts and non-experts.
  
 What You’ll Need:
  
 Pursuing MS degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Information Science, Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Anthropology, or a related field or equivalent practical experience.
 Experience conducting qualitative and/or quantitative research ideally with at least one project to show you've worked in this domain.
  
 Bonus Points if:
  
 Pursuing a PhD degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Information Science, Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, Anthropology, or a related field.
 Relevant work experience with User Experience or Human-Computer Interaction teams.
 Track record of demonstrating excellent command of research methods that impact organizational or product decisions.
  
 About the Team
  
 The UX Research team works to drive product innovation and build empathy with our users. At Uber we ship products on a global scale for a wide range of users and the UX Research team is a central part of how we build reliable and delightful experiences. Our team leverages a wide range of both qualitative and quantitative approaches to uncover insights and bring the voice of the user into product development.
  
 All submissions will be reviewed and qualified candidates contacted in January 2018 for next steps.
