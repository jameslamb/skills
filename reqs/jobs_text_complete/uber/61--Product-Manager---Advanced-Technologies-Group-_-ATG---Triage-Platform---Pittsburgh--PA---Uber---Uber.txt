 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 At Uber ATG, we employ a variety of testing methodologies to make our vehicles as safe as possible, including on-road testing, structured testing on the track, and virtual simulations. When the technology doesn’t meet our expectations for any reason, your products enable the organization to understand what happened. From root cause introspection to diagnosis and synthesis for the autonomy development teams, your products form the tip of the spear in improving safety and comfort of our self-driving vehicles.  As the PM for Triage, you will work closely with technical teams of engineers, data scientists, and designers to develop and scale software platforms that are critical towards launching the world’s safest autonomous vehicles.
 What You’ll Do
 Own the vision for Triage Platform, conceptualizing impactful and innovative products that bridge your customer obsession with our business strategy
 Execute on that product vision with clear product requirements, a strong bias to action, perseverance, and teamwork
 Inspire your colleagues and leadership team to take on big, bold bets with effective storytelling
 Design solutions with our engineering, UX design, and data science teams, creatively solving problems to build magical products
 What You’ll Need
 Experience building simulation software
 Computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent
 Minimum 8 years product management experience delivering highly successful, innovative, and delightful software products
 Exceptional verbal and written communication skills, with experience leading presentations to executives and large groups of people
 Experience leading, recruiting, and mentoring teams of product managers
 Experience with a variety of development processes, including agile / lean startup
 Deep passion for Uber’s mission and self-driving vehicles
 Bonus Points If
 Professional software engineering experience
 Experience building machine learning based products, especially in the context of systems with humans in the loop
 Familiarity with content management systems, analytics tools, and data visualization
 Understanding of modern data technologies
 About the Team
