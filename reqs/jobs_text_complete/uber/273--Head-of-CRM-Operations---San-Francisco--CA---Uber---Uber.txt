 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 Every month, hundreds of millions of customers receive communications from Uber via email, sms, in-app messages, push notifications and more.
  
 To ensure our communications systems are optimized for the growing needs of the business, we’re looking for an experienced technical marketing leader to set the vision for CRM Operations at Uber and to lead and grow the CRM Operations team.
  
 In this role, you’ll be responsible for the operational excellence of all email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messaging we send. You’ll have the support of an in-house analytics team and the ability to partner with product and engineering to bring complex, high-impact multi-quarter system roadmaps to life.
  
 What You’ll Do
 Coach and mentor a team of highly effective deployment specialists managing all large scale automated and ad-hoc customer communications
 Act as the primary technology consultant to internal teams throughout the company on campaigns that impact the end customer experience
 Outline optimal systems architecture and systems integration to better target and deliver communications
 Build multi-quarter roadmaps that improve the quality, efficiency, and abilities of our comms and customer marketing technology
 Identify and onboard third party tools to enhance our marketing tech stack
 Establish, report on, and improve KPIs associated with campaign deployment, operational excellence, and platform health
 Empower and enable local marketing teams to achieve business goals through communication
 Partner with key stakeholders on internal platform teams and drive the evolution and enhancements of Uber’s communications tools
  
 What You’ll Need
 At least 10 years of experience in the marketing technology space
 Experience leading and motivating a high performing team
 Strong technical background and conceptual or working knowledge of HTML, CSS, SQL, scripting languages, etc.
 A track-record of defining successful roadmaps involving marketing operations, systems integration and customer communication
 Hands on experience with CRM technology including ESPs, segmentation tools, and complex data structures and systems
