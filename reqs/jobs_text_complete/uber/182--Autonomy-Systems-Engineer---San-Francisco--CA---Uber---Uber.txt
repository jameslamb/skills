 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 We are a team working expertly to develop and automate sensor data extraction, metrics and analysis pipelines, ML training and inference, system optimizations, GPU development, and embedded performance optimizations. 
 We’re building a multi-disciplinary team devoted to building distributed ML systems for our autonomy pipelines.
 What You’ll Do
 Develop infrastructure systems that support training and evaluation of deep learning and other ML algorithms used by self-driving vehicles
 Improve the performance, reliability, and automation of autonomy pipelines that perform ML and data analysis
  
 What You’ll Need
 Degree in engineering or computer science related discipline or equivalent work experience -- positions are available at the PhD, MS, and BS levels
 Software development skills in C/C++ and/or Python
 Experience building distributed computer systems and/or performing large-scale data analysis and visualization (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)
 Excellent presentation and communication skills
 Knowledge of computer vision and machine learning fundamentals, especially deep learning, are a plus
  
 About the Team
  
  
 At the Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. Our teams in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. Our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.
