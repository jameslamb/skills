 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today.
  
 We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About
  the Role
  
 Uber's payments team is based in Amsterdam, at the heart of our international engineering efforts. As a member of our team, you will dig into the complex but rewarding world of money, and work to enhance the platform with third-party payment integrations.
  
 What You’ll Do
  
 Take a full-stack approach. Each integration is unique and often requires a back-end, mobile and web component. You will be part of a cross-functional team which is developing the overall experience and architecture.
 Contribute at a global scale. Despite being based in Amsterdam, we work on integration for the overall Uber platform. Those integrations include Alipay (300M users in China) and Paypal (173M users). Our systems support the entirety of Uber's rider payments platform worldwide.
 Manage scale & reliability. Our solutions support Uber's always-on marketplace. Maintaining this platform at scale requires constant investment in security, reliability and monitoring tooling.
 Innovate. We create platforms: payments is a central initiative for Uber, and we are constantly innovating in this field.
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 In-depth knowledge of the Android application framework
 Advanced knowledge of at least one programming language, and of OOP patterns
 Proficient writing unit/functional tests
 Fluent with Java 7 and have an in-depth knowledge of the Android SDK
 Experience working with test automation frameworks
 Commitment to quality, performance, and efficiency
 Experience in taking ownership
 Design and business insight
  
 Bonus Points
  
 Experience with other mobile platforms and iOS in particular
 Full-stack development experience, including backend API design and applications development
 Experience working in systems handling high volume financial transactions
