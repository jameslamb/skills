 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the role
  
 Every month, hundreds of thousands of drivers across the US and Canada depend on Uber for a flexible, reliable way to earn money.
  
 Drivers form the backbone of the platform and to help them get the most out of Uber, we’re looking for an experienced marketing leader to set the vision for driver marketing at Uber and to lead and grow the driver lifecycle team.
  
 In this role, you’ll be responsible for the quality and impact of all communications our drivers receive across email, SMS, and push notifications, and in-app messaging.  You’ll have the support of a dedicated design, copy, operations, and analytics team and the ability to partner with product and engineering to bring complex, high-impact new campaigns to life in a way that surprises and delights our customers.
  
 What You'll Do
 Manage a team of highly effective lifecycle marketers managing onboarding, engagement, retention and loyalty initiatives for our North America driver base.
 Establish, report on, and improve KPIs for all driver communications.
 Partner with the product, operations, BD teams to optimize the customer experience inside and out of the app.
 Help define the tools and technology required to deliver real-time, highly relevant, personalized communications for drivers.
 Empower and enable local marketing teams to achieve business goals through communications.
  
 What You'll Need
 Minimum 8 years experience in the customer marketing, customer communications, or customer engagement space.
 Experience leading and motivating high performing marketing teams.
 A track-record of demonstrable business results through testing and deploying effective marketing campaigns across channels.
 Strong familiarity with CRM technology including ESPs, Segmentation tools, and complex data structures and systems.
 Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience, MBA preferred.
  
 Perks
 Employees are given Uber credits every month.
 The rare opportunity to change the way the world moves. We're not just another social web app, we're moving real people and assets and reinventing transportation and logistics globally.
 Smart, engaged co-workers.
  
 Benefits
 401(k) plan, gym reimbursement, nine paid company holidays.
 Full medical/dental/vision package to fit your needs.
 Unlimited vacation policy; take time when you need it.
