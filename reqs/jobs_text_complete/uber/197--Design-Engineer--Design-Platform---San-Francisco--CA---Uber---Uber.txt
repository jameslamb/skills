 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

 Define and build tools and frameworks that can be largely used by the broader design and engineering team for a variety of needs, e.g., as a medium for designers to communicate an idea, as a tool for user research, or as a high-fidelity specification for engineers to build from.
 Evangelize the importance of prototyping and help set up the frameworks and tools that empower designers to rapidly realize their prototypes.
 Develop prototyping methods Contribute to production code base.
