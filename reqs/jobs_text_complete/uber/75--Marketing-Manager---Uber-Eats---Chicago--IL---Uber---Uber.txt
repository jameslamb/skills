 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 The Uber Eats Marketing Manager role is a unique opportunity to help grow one of Uber’s newest services: Uber Eats, which is in the process of expanding in a big way. Uber Eats is looking for a marketing manager who can take charge of the customer story for Uber Eats in the Midwest while meticulously unpacking the key growth levers for our business. This is an intense “startup-within-a-startup” role, and as a part of the team the right person will be comfortable in an “all hands on deck” environment able to operate and coordinate across multiple teams. You will work with the Uber Eats operations, design, product, growth marketing teams to execute and measure marketing tactics, effectively communicate our brand, and grow our business. You should be equally at home drafting an email campaign or social post, managing key external partner relationships or  or using a spreadsheet to analyze the results of a campaign. Above all, you bring keen business judgement, and an intuitive ability to match effort with business impact.
 What you'll do:
 Opportunity Identification: Leverage data and experimentation to identify the highest value opportunities for communication or partnerships 
 Informing Promotional Spend Decisions: Act as a thought partner to the General Manager concerning decisions on how to best deploy team time and financial resources in order to accelerate market penetration and to capture market share 
 Campaign Planning & Prioritization: Structure communication message and delivery (e.g. channel, format) in order to achieve targeted  outreach goals based on need and opportunity
 New Communication Channels: Help develop our expertise around new communications mediums like social, email and newsletter marketing, etc. 
 Partnership Development: Identify strategic partnerships to grow the Uber Eats brand and build awareness in the city — this could be a campaign with a well-known chef or restaurant, to a partnership with a major food event in the city
 Content Crafting: Serve as the voice of the Uber Eats brand in the Midwest, helping to establish content that is beautiful , approachable, fun and action-oriented
 Chief Growth Officer: Be able to speak to and own our growth metrics and drive our curve up and to the right
 Hack and accelerate our path to a market leadership position
  
 What you'll need:
 Bachelor’s degree from a 4-year university and a demonstrated quantitative ability 
 4+ years of digital or email marketing, user analytics, and/or consulting experience in a fast paced environment
 Experience making data-driven marketing decisions using funnel tracking, A/B testing, and other analytical tools; experience with SQL or other database querying tools an asset
 An eye for design, and comfort wielding tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
 Strong written communication skills and ability to craft a brand voice
 Ability to take initiative in a constantly-changing work environment and a willingness to adopt a generalist mindset
 Growth hacking - knowing how to meticulously unpack the key levers for growing a business through keen analysis and experimentation
 Startup (all-hands-on-deck) approach
 Passion for the on-demand delivery space, and food delivery in particular
