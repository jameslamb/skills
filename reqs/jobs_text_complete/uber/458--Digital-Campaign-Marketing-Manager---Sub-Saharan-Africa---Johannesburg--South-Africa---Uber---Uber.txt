 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About The Role
  
 We’re searching for a customer obsessed individual who will be responsible for:
  
 Increasing engagement with the Uber brand by more regular but sensible exchange with riders across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
 Conceptualisation, planning, development and execution of Rider Lifecycle campaigns across multiple channels including email, In-app, SMS, Push notifications
