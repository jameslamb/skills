 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 The Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT) at Uber receives requests for user data from law enforcement agencies around the globe every hour of every day.  Some of those requests involve exigent circumstances which require an immediate response.  
  
 Every request Uber receives by law enforcement must be checked for legal compliance by LERT to ensure it follows our strict processes on how to handle these requests. Once reviewed for legal compliance and satisfied that the request is lawful, LERT produces only that data specific to law enforcement’s request.
  
 LERT at Uber is seeking a passionate, highly-motivated, detail-oriented person to be a part of the LERT team processing requests from law enforcement for user data. The LERT Lead must have excellent judgement, work well under pressure, prioritize effectively, and work collaboratively with multiple regional teams and HQ in San Francisco.
 What You’ll Do
 Ensure that the team follows company policies and procedures in responding to requests from law enforcement in a timely manner.
 Manage escalations quickly and appropriately.
 Identify issues/roadblocks, consider solutions, consult stakeholders, and follow implementation procedures.
 Foster a supportive and collaborative environment for teamwork.
 Work closely with regional stakeholders to build trust.
 This is a contract role  
 What You’ll Need
 Must have a reading, writing and conversational fluency in English. Proficiency in additional local languages is a plus.
 Must have strong written and verbal communication skills.
 Must have high level of comfort interacting with law enforcement while maintaining highest level of professionalism.
 Must work with careful attention to detail.
 Must be willing and able to participate in rotational on-call duty.
 Must have working proficiency with office systems and applications (MS Office, Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, Salesforce, ZenDesk, JIRA, etc.)
 About the Team
  
 Security is a top priority for Uber. The team is constantly innovating and developing new ways to make Uber a safe & secure platform in every city. If you are a strategic thinker with an analytical mind and a customer-focused attitude, then we would love to have you join our team. This is your chance to solve complex problems and help build a best-in-class global security program.
