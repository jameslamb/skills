 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 As Uber continues to expand its services and technologies to airports around the world, the Business Development (BD) team is looking for a motivated and hands-on leader who thrives in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment and is excited to make Uber an indispensable part of every airport.
 As a Business Development Manager, you will serve as a product and industry expert who will manage and grow Uber’s airports business and also build the business development strategy across all markets. This is also a highly cross-functional role, as you will coordinate across a number of internal teams including product, compliance, policy, and operations.
 Externally, you will cultivate and manage our partnerships and relationships with airports around the world, industry associations, and other key stakeholders and develop a scalable strategy to ultimately drive revenue growth.
 What You’ll Do
 Coordinate closely with Uber’s product, compliance, policy and operations teams to define priorities, build relationships, and lead cross-functional processes related to the airports business
 Represent Uber’s Airports Business team internally and externally at senior levels
 Support the airport deal process from relationship building and due diligence, to post-contract signing integration, and throughout the entire course of our operational relationship
 Track, analyze, and communicate key metrics to internal and external stakeholders, and negotiate and execute new growth and optimization initiatives
 Create scalable and strategic programs for sourcing, onboarding, and developing airport relationships
  
 What You'll Need
 Minimum 7 years of experience in business development with management consulting, investment banking, or public policy expertise
 Experience working with the airports industry
 Proven track record of building and executing on partnerships
 Strong use of insights and data-driven decision making
 Startup hustle and passion for our mission
 Solid understanding of a variety of business models
 Extremely proactive, self starter mentality with strong organizational skills
 Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to identify and provide comprehensive solutions for varying partner needs
 Ability to thrive under pressure in an unstructured, fast paced environment
