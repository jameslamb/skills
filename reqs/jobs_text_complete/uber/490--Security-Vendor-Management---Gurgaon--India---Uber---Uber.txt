 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 As a Security Vendor Management – India, you will be responsible for the security of Uber’s people, properties, and assets throughout the India region. You will work cross functionally with local, regional and HQ leadership to execute on globally focused projects, and own the development and execution of all security processes and programs in region.
 WHAT YOU’LL DO
  
 Act as first POC for security vendor management for all locations and staff in India, Srilanka and Bangladesh.
 Under the guidance of Regional Security Manager – India, coordinate performance and service delivery of all Physical Security vendors within region.
 Educate vendors on Uber culture, SLAs, KPIs and Customer Service Expectations

 Other security and vendor management related duties as directed by the Regional Security Manager
