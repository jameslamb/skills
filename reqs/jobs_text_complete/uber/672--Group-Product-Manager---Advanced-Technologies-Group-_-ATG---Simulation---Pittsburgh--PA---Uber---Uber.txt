 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 At Uber ATG, we employ a variety of testing methodologies to make our vehicles as safe as possible, and virtual simulation is a critical part of our strategy. As the Group Product Manager for Simulation, you will lead a team of product managers in working closely with engineers, data scientists, and designers to develop and scale software platforms that are critical towards launching the world’s safest autonomous vehicles. You will be responsible for directing and delivering simulation tools and platforms that are relied upon by every engineer in the organization.
 What You’ll Do
  
 Own the vision for simulation at ATG, pursuing impact opportunities for simulation (software and algorithm modeling and development, functional safety analysis, vehicle hardware, sensor performance simulation as examples)
 Lead and recruit a product management team that builds intelligent tools around scenario discovery, playback, development, management, evaluation, and analytics as well as platforms for the simulation engine, metrics, and infrastructure
 Expand the breadth and depth of our end-to-end system testing, and align that testing with customer requirements and product development plans
 Synthesize the outputs of simulations to guide autonomy software development
 Bring ATG’s thought leadership to the industry on how simulation is involved in the safety case for self-driving vehicles
  
 What You’ll Need
 Experience building simulation software
 Computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent
 Minimum 8 years product management experience delivering highly successful, innovative, and delightful software products
 Exceptional verbal and written communication skills, with experience leading presentations to executives and large groups of people
 Experience leading, recruiting, and mentoring teams of product managers

 Deep passion for Uber’s mission and self-driving vehicles
