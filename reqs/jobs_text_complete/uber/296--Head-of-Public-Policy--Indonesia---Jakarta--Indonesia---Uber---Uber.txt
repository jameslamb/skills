 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, policy roles are business critical and can have a real impact on our potential growth in each market. Policy at Uber is for people who are keen to have skin in the game on business decisions and are excited about being an advocate for change.   
  
 The reforms needed are relatively simple: the right for one citizen to drive another citizen across town so long as certain important consumer protections requirements are met. The idea is not all that radical. But in many cities outdated regulations are holding back progress-and in places where reform has been possible, entrenched interests often try to turn the clock back.
  
 We are looking for someone to lead our Government Affairs & Public Policy efforts in Indonesia reporting the Director of Public Policy for Asia Pacific. Uber has expanded rapidly in Indonesia and currently operates in 34 Indonesian cities.
  
  
  
 What You’ll Do
  
 Establish Uber's brand and profile with policy makers-including governments, third parties and academics
 Work to ensure that the regulatory framework in Indonesia supports ridesharing apps like Uber
 Partner with the government and third parties on innovative transport solutions 
 Be an external advocate and represent the company at public and stakeholder events, and with the media when required
 Lead a smart, dynamic team based in Jakarta
  
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 A self starter: Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up. Situations changes fast in our world so you'll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure
 A great advocate: We're looking to create new frameworks that encourage innovation and alternatives to individual car ownership. You'll need the intellectual rigor to grasp complex policy issues as well as the ability to articulate clearly and simply how apps like Uber can help improve transportation for everyone
 A gifted campaigner: We are changing the world in a way that is positive for the communities where we operate but change can be uncomfortable. You'll need to put together proactive campaigns involving passengers, drivers and third parties that demonstrate there's a better alternative to today's outdated status quo. That means having a bias for action in everything you do and a willingness to engage in debates
 A team player: Success at Uber depends on the ability to organize different teams (internally and externally) around shared goals. It's why we're looking for well organized people who enjoy working with others to get things done and who can deal with the ambiguity that sometimes comes from working cross-functionally
 Ideally you would have at least 10 years of experience in government affairs and policy
