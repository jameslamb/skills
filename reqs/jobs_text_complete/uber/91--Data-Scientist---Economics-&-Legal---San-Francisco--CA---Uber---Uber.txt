 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Team
 This data science and economics team works with the Legal team on Uber’s most important legal issues. We work with the Legal team to develop analyses and arguments—based on data, economics, and the law—to defend Uber against risks in litigation and provide regulators answers to their requests for information.
 About this Role
 Data Scientists on the this team work at the intersection of data science, economics, and the law. The data analyst is responsible for developing a deep understanding of Uber's databases and their quirks as well as assembling, analyzing, and telling compelling stories with data.
 What We’re Looking For
 Responsibilities
 Describe and explain Uber’s data to lawyers, regulators, and other key stakeholders
 Generate ideas for analyses to advance Uber’s legal goals
 Design queries of our databases that can be replicated to satisfy Uber’s legal data reporting requirements
 Collaborate with cross-functional teams across disciplines such as business development and engineering
 Requirements
 2-4 years of experience and a bachelor’s or master’s degree in Math, Economics, Statistics, Engineering, Computer Science, or other quantitative field preferred
 Strong data skills and a shown ability to use tools such as SQL, Python, and R to work efficiently at scale
 Balance attention to detail with swift execution, including the ability to deliver on tight timelines
 Hustle is critical, as moving quickly and executing to allow for continual iteration is a strength of our team
 Self-motivated with the ability to work independently
 Strong communication and organization skills
 Experience working with a legal group or interest in Uber’s global legal and policy issues is a plus
 Ideally you are not only fluent in the language of data but are also an adept written and verbal communicator. You should have the ability to get through to external parties and help them understand the nuances of our arguments. Fluency in English, both oral and written, is critical.
