 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
  
 The most successful consumer technology companies are brilliant storytellers, who put their products—as well as the benefits of those products—front and center in every communication.  
 Our team is responsible for telling Uber’s story to the media and third parties:  whether it’s transforming how we get around town and the lives of people who value independent, flexible work; or cutting congestion in cities by getting more backsides into fewer cars.  That’s partly about building lasting relationships with the key news outlets and journalists in every country where we operate.  It also about being creative in how we tell our story, including the use of social media, as well as working with the public policy team to develop campaigns that make the positive case for reform
 .
 What You’ll Do
  
 Establishing Uber’s brand and profile with the media and third parties, specifically with consumer, product and lifestyle oriented outlets; 
 Working to tell our story
 —and the story of ridesharing—in creative, inspiring ways that resonate with journalists and on social media while having a limited product presence on the ground;
 Combining crisis management with running proactive comms projects across the country
 Running a busy press office and managing relationships with journalists on both national and regional level.
 Providing comms strategic support for the business and policy goals in Germany 
 External facing of stakeholders - editors, reporters, opinion makers and third parties
 Team and external agency management 
 Cross-functional projects management
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 To succeed you’ll need to be:
 A self starter:  Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up too.  Stuff changes fast in our world so you’ll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure;
 A great advocate
 :  We’re looking for people who can distill complex ideas into simple, but intellectually credible, arguments.  You’ll need to write well and have the creative ability to tell stories—about our product, people and the ways we’re helping to improve life for passengers, drivers and cities.  
 A strong campaigner:  
 Smartphone apps are disruptive, and the interests being disrupted are deeply entrenched.  We succeed by putting together effective campaigns with third parties on behalf of the passengers and drivers who use the app.  That means you’ll have a bias for action in everything you do—and a willingness to engage in debates, that can often become heated.
 A team player
 :  Success at Uber depends on the ability to organize different teams (internally and externally) around shared goals.  It’s why we’re looking for well organized people who enjoy working with others to get stuff done—and who can deal with the ambiguity that sometimes comes from working cross-functionally.   
  
 Ideally you would have 8-10 years experience in communications/PR/journalism and a good knowledge of the German market.
