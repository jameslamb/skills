 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next. 
 The Role
  
 UberEATS is our food delivery platform that makes getting great food from your favorite local restaurants as easy as requesting a ride. As a Product Manager for UberEATS Couriers, you will envision and execute on a strategy for enabling the long-term success of a courier on the UberEATS platform. What insights and feedback do couriers need to know in order to improve their performance? How do we take courier preferences into account when designing our delivery systems? How might we reward and delight loyal couriers? How do we drive retention and build a strong relationship with a courier from the moment they sign up with Uber? As the Product Manager for UberEATS Couriers, these are the types of questions you will wrestle with every day. You will lead this critical component of our new business, working closely with colleagues across Engineering, Design, Operations, Data Science and Marketing to bring your ideas to life.
  
  
 Qualification & Requirements
 Minimum 4-6 years experience delivering highly successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them — and you’re extremely proud of what you’ve accomplished
 Computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent, ideally including hands-on software engineering experience. Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the metal
 Focused on building businesses, not features. Entrepreneurial experience building and leading businesses, including ownership and optimization of business performance metrics
 Customer obsessed. You take on complex product challenges and simplify them to avoid making them our users and partner’s problems
 Finger-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
 “Driver” personality. You are biased toward action, a great collaborator, a master disambiguator/simplifier, and constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery
 Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on
 High bar across the board — from your own contributions, to the people you work with, to the products you work on
 True passion for Uber’s mission, our products, and the company’s hybrid technology/operations nature
 Never-ending desire to grow and learn
