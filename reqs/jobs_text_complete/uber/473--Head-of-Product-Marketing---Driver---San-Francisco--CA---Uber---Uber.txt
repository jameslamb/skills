 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next. 
  
 The Role
  
 As the Head of Product Marketing for the Driver team, you will define and bring to life the product marketing strategy for our driver partners. You will lead a team responsible for shaping the product roadmap, developing the product positioning, building go-to-market plans and owning the growth strategy for all Driver-facing products. You will work with your team to drive highly impactful programs to acquire, activate, engage and retain our driver partners. Your performance will be measured by your team’s ability to partner effectively with a high-performing cross-functional team that includes counterparts in Product Management, Design, Data Science, Engineering, and Operations to meet shared objectives and key results. 
  
  
 Qualifications & Requirements
 Passion for Uber’s mission and the company’s hybrid technology / operations nature.
 15+ years combined product and growth marketing experience delivering highly successful growth, user acquisition and engagement strategies, with a focus on developer marketing.
 Finger-tippinesses with data: You just go get the data you need with no muss/fuss and can whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage data to make decisions and drive growth. You have experience running rigorous multivariate testing.
 Top-notch at market research: You’re a truth-seeking missile. You know your market, customers and competition better than anyone, and you’re strong at integrating this information into your growth strategies.
 Master storyteller: You can craft a compelling narrative across different channels - you know how to match the message to the medium
 Scary-good at articulating the essence of products and the value they create. You can develop a strong messaging hierarchy and effective content strategy plan. You can also play copywriter.
 An “owner” personality: You’re biased toward action, a great collaborator and master disambiguator/simplifier. You never stop pushing towards clarity and delivery.
 A master of test-and-learn growth hacking: You possess an uncanny ability to run and iterate on highly effective automated marketing campaigns.
 Grittiness: You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on, you persevere when others fall away.
