 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About The Role
  
 As a Language Manager for Indonesia,
  you'll work closely with our Product, Brand, Marketing, Regional and Operation teams to stay ahead of localizing content for product launches, marketing initiatives, and support releases. You’ll be the main point of contact to manage the work completed by external vendors, ensuring that they have the tools and coaching needed to deliver high-quality content. You’re not averse to localizing high-visibility content yourself, but you also understand the importance of scaling your efforts to meet the needs of the growing business.
 What You'll Do
  
 Own and manage linguistic quality of digital & print assets from English into Indonesian
 Work with vendor resources to deliver localized content, handling high priority and high visibility content yourself
 Dedicate time to perform LQAs of our apps & website
 Use data to determine quality trends for your language and create action plans to address any systemic issues
 Fix linguistic bugs and flag internationalization issues to the relevant product teams
 Evangelize localization services with key stakeholders in both HQ and abroad
 Continually update Style Guides and Glossaries for your language
 Liaise between Uber product teams and Localization Program Management to recommend best practices for internationally-friendly product design
 Travel to the region twice yearly to develop and maintain relationships with regional stakeholders
 Own quality for more than one language as you grow in the role
  
 What You’ll Need
 Professional fluency in Indonesian
 B.A. in Translation, Linguistics, or similar field of study
 Minimum 3 years of localization experience, preferably in the tech industry
 Experience using CAT tools (e.g. Smartling, WorldServer, Trados, Memsource, etc.)
 Experience managing Translation Memories, Glossaries, and Style Guides
 Excellent written and verbal communication skills
 Passionate about Uber and our mission
 Bonus Points If
 Master’s Degree in related field
 About The Team

As an early member of our Localization Team, you'll have the opportunity to build the local roots of an expanding global brand.
