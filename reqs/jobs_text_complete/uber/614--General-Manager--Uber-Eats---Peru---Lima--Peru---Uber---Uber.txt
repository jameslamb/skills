 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 Uber Everything is the division of Uber that reliably delivers things faster and more affordably than going to get them yourself. This year we are launching Uber Eats in Peru. We'll partner with hundreds of iconic restaurants to deliver the best of the city at Uber speed.
  
 As the General Manager for Uber Everything, you will lead growth, operations, and expansion of the Uber Everything business in Peru. We are looking for the rare combination of analytical aptitude, resourcefulness, people management, customer passion, optimistic leadership, and a passion for the business we will create together.

 Work closely with our product and engineering teams to drive product development
 Develop strategic partnerships, particularly with top-flight players in the food industry
 Rapid experimentation - innovate and iterate quickly, share learnings and best practices with your counterparts in other Uber Everything cities around the world
  
 What You'll Need
  
 A minimum of 6 years of experience in business management is expected, but we will consider candidates with less experience if they meet our other requirements
  (e.g., management consulting, private equity, investment banking, operations) in a fast-paced environment

 Excellent business judgment, and a bias towards data-driven decision making
 Entrepreneurial spirit: drive, proactive, excited to innovate and resolve the toughest problems through new and exciting ideas
 Optimistic leadership: Taking initiative to seize opportunities. Roll up your sleeves and get into the details approach. Recruit and develop future leaders for Uber Everything
