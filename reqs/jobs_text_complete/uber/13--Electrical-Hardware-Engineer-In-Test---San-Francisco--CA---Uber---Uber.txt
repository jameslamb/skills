 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 As a hardware test engineer on the V&V team, you will participate in the engineering process from start to finish: Determine engineering requirements, develop hardware test plans, develop test cases, design/build test fixtures, execute tests and document/analyze results to validate components and systems.

 Perform verification, validation and testing activities
 Testing of circuit boards, cameras, lidar, radar, micro controllers and computer systems
 Design, build and maintain electrical test fixtures
 Develop test cases to validate hardware/software integration
 Develop tools and methods to automate testing for rapid deployment
 Perform a wide range of tests (e.g. analog, digital timing, reliability, burn-in, in-circuit testing, functional testing, etc.)
 Programming in C-like languages, and high-level languages like Python, LabView or Matlab.
 Utilize data acquisition systems
 Maintain engineering processes, documentation, and configuration management
  
 What You’ll Need
 Creative problem solving for complex electrical systems
 Prototype development and testing experience
 Broad general EE knowledge
 Ability to design, build and maintain hardware-in-the-loop testing environments
 Experience debugging problems with communication data links
