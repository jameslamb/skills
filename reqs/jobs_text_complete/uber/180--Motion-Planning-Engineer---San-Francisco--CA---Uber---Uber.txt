 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
  
 The Motion Planning Engineer will have their software make critical decisions rather than just “process” or “display” data. This person will be passionate and experienced with crafting motion planning systems to make great decisions, every time, in all conditions.
 What You'll Do
  
 Motion planning is the brain of an autonomous driving system. It handles the core reasoning for driving behaviors and, as you can imagine, is one of our core challenges. Using real-world data gathered from over 1 million miles of autonomously driven roads, you will apply your knowledge of motion planning to help shape the behaviors of our self-driving uber.  How do I execute a lane change?  How do I safely pickup and drop off a customer? How do I behave when merging with other traffic? If this gets you pumped, then come help us change the world!
  
 What You'll Need
 MS/PhD degree in Computer Science or related field
 Experience programming in C++ on a real world robotic system
 Direct experience in nonlinear and linear optimal control techniques including LQE/LQG, H-infinity, or other robust control techniques 
 Model predictive control experience
 Prior experience in motion planning in robotics
 Numerical optimization techniques (e.g., nonlinear constrainted optimization) and dynamic programming experience
 Understanding of vehicle dynamics and modeling
 Proven ability to product computationally efficient software that can meet real-time requirements
  
 Bonus Points If
 Linear control techniques and methods for analysis
 Experience working on safety-critical systesm
 Vehicle state estimation/localization experience
  
 About the Team
  
 At the Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. Our teams in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. Our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.
