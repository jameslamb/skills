 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 Our Cargo Claims Advocate will own the administration and resolution of cargo claims (any OSD claims) with our shippers, receivers and carriers. The Cargo Claims Advocate will build out processes and work streams for the handling of cargo claims, and will grow and lead a team to work on these claims as the business continues to grow. The Cargo Claims Advocate will also ensure the proper and efficient handling of claims with an aim of maintaining good shipper and carrier relationships, all in accordance with applicable legal, insurance and contractual requirements.

 Notify customer and carrier of claim filings and/or rejected claims and work with the customer to understand the value of damaged products and how the product should be handled
 Determine next steps and order inspections in order to support the claim with the customer or carrier in an effort for resolution. Evaluate police and independent inspector reports, including video, written incident reports, etc. in claim resolution
