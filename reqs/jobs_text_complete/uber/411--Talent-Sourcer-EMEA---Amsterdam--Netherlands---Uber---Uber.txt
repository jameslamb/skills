 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 Here, at Uber, we pride ourselves on the amazing team we’ve built. Delivering a first class, on-demand transportation experience takes a critical eye for quality, and we want a sourcer who has the same critical eye. Our sourcers should be able to find the diamonds in the rough.
 We are growing rapidly and need someone with hustle to help us continue to grow our core teams across EMEA.
 The right person will be comfortable in an "all hands on deck" environment, loves solving people problems and can thrive in a startup culture. This role is all about bringing on the smartest folks, maintaining our culture as we grow, and running an efficient process to keep it moving.
 Still think this is you? Well then, keep reading!
