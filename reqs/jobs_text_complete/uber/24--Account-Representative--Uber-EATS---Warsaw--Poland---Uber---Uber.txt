 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 Who You Are
  
 We are looking for a skilled individual to help us take our UberEATS Poland business to the next level. This individual has excellent communication and problem-solving skills, 
 a logical, process-driven mindset, and a hustler’s attitude.
  
 The Account Representative role at UberEATS is a hands-on role responsible for driving growth, happiness, and retention among our base of restaurant partners. This role will focus on the growth of Uber’s restaurant relationships, while providing exceptional data-driven consultation to all areas of the business.

 Utilize data-driven decision making to identify growth and upsell opportunities improving the performance of our growth efforts. Prioritize initiatives based on highest potential impact for each side of our marketplace (Couriers, Eaters, and Restaurant partners).
 Identifying, tracking and improving critical business metrics: using sound business thinking you create actionable plans to improve restaurant related metrics and ensure fast and precise execution of these plans 
 Help scale the account management function: design processes, structure, and tools to effectively grow account management and bring learnings and best practices to all UberEATS markets.
 Take initiative to ensure our business is effective, whether that's stepping up to help our Onboarding team in getting new restaurants set up on the platform or cold calling restaurants during a new market launch to make sure they have all the tools to succeed
