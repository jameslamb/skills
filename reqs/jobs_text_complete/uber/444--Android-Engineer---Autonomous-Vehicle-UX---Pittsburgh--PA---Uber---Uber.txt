 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 In this role you will contribute to the design, development and maintenance of the user interfaces in Uber self-driving vehicles based on Android. This work is critical to Uber achieving scale with a self-driving fleet. These interfaces will play a critical role in many development activities as well as in the completion of rides for normal Uber riders.
 What You’ll Do
  
 Work as part of a team developing user interfaces for Uber’s self-driving vehicles
 Evaluate and debug your code out in the physical world
 Interact with others to coordinate backend and other Android work.
 Participate in architecture and design discussions for future development
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 Experience developing, prototyping, testing, releasing, and maintaining native Android applications (show us what you’ve done before and where we can find it)
 Extensive knowledge of Java or Kotlin, with strong design and interaction experience
 Experience collaborating on software projects with design and back-end aspects
 A product-oriented mindset; the ability to think beyond the task at hand and see the bigger picture the way an end user sees it.
 Great debugging skills and knowledge of the best tools
  
 Bonus Points
  
  
 Insightful opinions about developing for mobile
 Human Interface or Human UX experience is preferred
 Experience developing distributed systems
 Experience developing testing suites for mobile applications
 Experience with C++ or Python
 Experience with iOS development in Objective-C or Swift
 A GitHub account with some cool projects in it
  
 About the Team
  
 The Human Experience team is a multi-disciplinary team of devoted designers, mobile and robotics engineers working to deliver the highest quality user experience to vehicle operators and riders in Uber’s self-driving vehicles. Our work touches everything from industrial design, to hardware/electrical engineering, systems engineering, security, and application engineering.
