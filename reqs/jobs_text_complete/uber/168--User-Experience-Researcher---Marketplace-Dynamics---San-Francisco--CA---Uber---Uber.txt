 About Uber
  
 Uber is a technology company that is changing the way the world thinks about transportation. We are building technology people use everyday. Whether it's heading home from work, getting a meal delivered from a favorite restaurant, or a way to earn extra income, Uber is becoming part of the fabric of daily life.
  
 We're making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. And we're doing it at a global scale-energizing local economies and bringing opportunity to millions of people around the world.
  
 Uber's positive impact is tangible in the communities we operate in, and that drives us to keep moving forward.
 Our Design Research Team is seeking an experienced User Researcher for Marketplace Dynamics. The work is fascinating; Marketplace Dynamics is building the logistics network of the future, taking on some of the hardest problems related to improving Uber's real time marketplace.
  
 These challenging problems--qualitative and quantitative--include: optimizing Uber's dynamic pricing system; providing real time positioning guidance to drivers; optimizing dispatches of drivers to incoming requests; matching riders for UberPool, and many more.
  
 Behind our apps is an internationally diverse world of amazing cities, transportation logistics, market making, and interactions among drivers, riders, and businesses.
  
 We're also here for personal reasons. We want to turn cities from grey to green. We want to replace parking with parks. We believe that people are one of the most important assets to Uber and because of that we foster an environment that is welcoming to diverse perspectives.
