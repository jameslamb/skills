 Here are the kinds of skills we're looking for:
 Fast
  
 learner
 . We’re looking for team members who flourish by applying their knowledge, learning new technologies and don’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. You should be able to adapt easily to meet the rapid pace of a rapidly evolving research, development, and testing environment.
 Fearlessness
 . You think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point. You strive on showing that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time.
 Versatility
 . In addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance.
 Passion
 . You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design "released" until you’re confident it’s correct. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage.
 A
  
 team
  
 player
 . You believe that you can achieve more on a team — that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement.
 Design
  
 and
  
 business
  
 acumen
 . You understand requirements beyond the written word and how your technical contributions will influence the viability of future products. Whether you’re working on a software library used by other developers, a sensor to be retrofitted on a test vehicle, or a printed circuit to be mass produced, the other members of the team can depend on the quality of your work to rapidly advance our goals.
