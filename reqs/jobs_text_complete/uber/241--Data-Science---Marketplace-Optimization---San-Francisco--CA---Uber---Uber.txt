 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 Are you interested in working at the intersection of applied quantitative research, engineering development, and data analytics? Do you have interest in developing and applying quantitative solutions related to Uber’s problems? If so, then this is the job for you.
  
 Marketplace Data Scientists embed with Uber’s various marketplace related product and engineering initiatives to help them solve advanced quantitative issues in real-time systems. These fascinating and challenging problems include: building Uber’s dynamic pricing engine; identifying and predicting city specific traffic, travel, and demand patterns; optimizing the assignment process of matching/dispatching drivers to riders; and matching multiple riders to a driver for our UberPool product. Marketplace Data Scientists have the opportunity to take on some of Uber’s most innovative and impactful problems relating to the operational execution and economic decisions of the business. However, with great opportunity comes great expectations - this isn’t the job for everyone. We are looking for people with advanced quantitative degrees who are comfortable enough with research methodologies that they can pursue abstract business and engineering problems with acute precision, and who have the enthusiasm and initiative necessary to deliver those answers at Uber’s breakneck pace. You should have demonstrable programming skills (Python experience is even better) and be comfortable with the engineering development process - you’ll be working on engineering teams.
  
 Marketplace Data Scientists focus strongly on the mathematics and engineering related to 
 optimizing
  
 the
  
 economics
  
 and
  
 operations
  
 of
  
 Uber’s
  
 marketplace
 . Therefore, particular preference is given to candidates with backgrounds in Economics, Econometrics, Operations Research, Operations Management, Industrial Engineering, Statistics, or similar.
 Minimum 1 year practical data science or engineering work experience out of school, in the aforementioned domains'
 Strong quantitative background: MS or PhD preferred.
 Familiarity with technical tools for analysis - Python (with Pandas, etc.), R, SQL
 Programming chops - demonstrable familiarity (work experience, Github account) with programming concepts. Python skills and previous software engineering background a plus.
 Research mindst - ability to structure a project from idea to experimentation to prototype to implementation.
 Driven and focused self-starters, great communicators, amazing follow-through - you passionately pursue your work and love the responsibility of being individually empowered.
 A preference for quality over quantity - you get the math right and aspire to build the right solution; you like a team that holds each other to a high bar.
