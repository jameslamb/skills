 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, we pride ourselves on the amazing team we’ve built. It is our people who drive our growth, embody our bold, disruptive brand, and craft the game changing technology we are known for. As a recruiter you’ll have a direct hand in building one of the fastest growing technology companies of all time.
  
 We’re looking for a talented recruiter to work in our India Team to build and scale Uber across the region. You’ll partner with hiring managers to build the teams across Marketing and all Corporate functions in the region. You’ll own the hiring strategy for your teams and hustle to hire the brightest minds in the world. You’ll also work on strategic projects to improve and innovate on how we attract and recruit the best talent across India, because we know that there’s always a better way!
 What You’ll Do
 Partner directly with hiring managers and the India leadership team to build and scale their teams
 Source and hire top talent across India for our Marketing and Operations functions
 Own the hiring strategy and work closely with hiring teams to meet your hiring goals and targets
 Constantly improve recruiting processes and develop innovative ideas around finding top talent
 Be passionate about Uber and why people should work here
 Be an evangelist for Uber
 Candidate obsession! Manage your pipeline of candidates and identify what future opportunities they may be a fit for
 What You’ll Need
 Minimum of 7+ years of recruitment experience
 Successful recruiting tenure in a fast paced environment
 History of collaborating successfully with senior managers and business leaders
 Experience working on a variety of roles/levels
 Solid understanding of Uber’s vision, business model and operations
 Stellar networking skills and the ability to make smart recruiting partnerships happen
 Analytical approach; you understand and value backing up recruiting goals and projections with existing data (while never compromising the quality of the candidate experience)
 Bonus Points If
 A curious mind -  you're innovative, extremely creative and constantly looking for ways to improve how we do things
 An obsession with the candidate experience - you are self aware, well-spoken on the phone and eloquent in emails. You’re respectful of the candidate and how stressful a job hunt can be -- you never leave a candidate hanging
 Ownership - you’ll have superior organizational skills, integrity and always follow through on tasks. You don't get overwhelmed easily... thousands of Uber applicants each month? No prob
 Fun - You're a people-person who can talk to anyone; you're flexible, fearless, and excited to help build something awesome and share it with the world
 Motivated - you understand the impact of a highly-satisfied, excited crew; you are slightly obsessive-compulsive about grinding away at issues
 A team player - you're willing to help out wherever needed
