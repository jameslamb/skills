 Engineering Manager - Sensing, Inference, and Research (Maps)
 Manager, Engineering in San Francisco, CA
 Apply Now
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 As an Engineering Manager on the Maps Sensing, Inference, and Research team, you will be leading the team responsible for building the data infrastructure layer - backend and mobile, as well as improvements in Location Technology like improved rider, driver location in dense urban canyons. This team works with various others teams at Uber and solves uses cases based on the derived semantic inferences. The impact is across the entire product spectrum of Driver, Rider, Uber Eats etc.
