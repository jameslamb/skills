 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 As our company continues to expand aggressively, the Financial Planning & Analysis team is doing the same. We are building a finance team of leaders and athletes to tackle the challenges of efficiently scaling our dynamic, global business. We want you to bring considerable skill and experience to this role, but also humility and a team-player attitude, recognizing there's always more to learn and it's more fun doing it as part of a team.  
  
 As a lead in FP&A, you will help scale the team tasked with providing comprehensive financial insight into our business, while pushing to improve efficiency and growth.  You will help drive forecasting, planning and analysis initiatives, running with them to improve our business.
