 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the women and men who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer. 
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next. 
  
 On the Uber Everything team, we're building Uber's next generation of businesses. With UberEATS, we’re on a mission to make eating well effortless for everyone, everywhere. And with UberRUSH, we’re building the world’s logistics layer. If done right, we believe that these products will transform cities.
  
 As a designer on our team in NYC, you’ll take on tough challenges that cut across our business, consumer, and driver experiences, and you’ll help unlock world-changing new experiences. You’ll work among design-oriented engineers, product managers and some of the best designers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.
  
 We are highly user-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box. The role demands great execution, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness and optimism to be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the user in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.

 We might be a good match if...
  
 You’re
  
 a
  
 generalist
  
 with
  
 a
  
 sweet
  
 spot,
  
 or
  
 a
  
 specialist
  
 looking
  
 to
  
 broaden
  
 your
  
 skills
 You focus on UI, UX, or you’re a mythical unicorn. We’re interested in talented designers first, titles a distant second.
  
 You
  
 believe
  
 in
  
 craftsmanship
  
 and
  
 create
  
 elegant
  
 and
  
 compelling
  
 designs,
  
 over
  
 and
  
 over.
 Your portfolio has some premier work. You're a walking encyclopedia of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better.
  
 You’ve
  
 shipped
  
 product.
 You’ve weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, how to motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right, how to translate insights from user studies into meaningful action, and what’s most likely to go afoul at each stage. You can share several shining examples of real work you've shipped, and what you learned along the way.
  
 You
  
 substantially
  
 contribute
  
 to
  
 defining
  
 the
  
 'what'
  
 as
  
 well
  
 as
  
 the
  
 'how'.
 You're a product manager's secret weapon. You thrive best when helping to define the requirements, not just translating them into designs. You facilitate and draw the best design ideas from teammates.
  
 You
  
 can
  
 think
  
 and
  
 talk
  
 about
  
 the
  
 bottom
  
 line.
 Analytics don’t scare you, and you know which features can act as force multipliers on your company’s business model.
  
 Prototyping
  
 is
  
 a
  
 key
  
 part
  
 of
  
 your
  
 toolset.
 You’ve prototyped on multiple platforms. You’ve made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.
  
 Cross-platform
  
 is
  
 your
  
 style.
 Hopefully you’ve shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn’t, or why you’d opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android.
 We're still in the early stages of teaching this pony new tricks. We need brains and passion to make it happen and to make it happen in style.
