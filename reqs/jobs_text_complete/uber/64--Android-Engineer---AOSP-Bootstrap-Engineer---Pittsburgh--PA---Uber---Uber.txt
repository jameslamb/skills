 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
 In this role you will contribute to the creation, development and maintenance of the Android OS on custom-build hardware for use in Uber’s self-driving vehicles. This work is critical to Uber achieving scale with a self-driving fleet. This hardware, and the software built on top of it, will play a critical role in shaping the customer experience of riding in a self-driving car.
  
 What You’ll Do
  
 Help Uber’s self-driving fleet scale up dramatically
 Collaborate with an ODM to bootstrap and then evolve Android (AOSP) on new custom hardware
 Linux kernel hacking and writing and maintaining device drivers
 Participate in rigorous, low-level security validations
 Coordinate with and contribute to application-level Android development
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 A deep understanding of the Android NDK and OS-level components, system services, device drivers, etc.
 Android (or Linux) kernel hacking experience
 Strong programming skills in platform-relevant languages (Java & C/C++) and knowledge of modern software engineering best practices
 Experience with, and devotion to, testing your code
 Passion for software security - an ability to think like your enemy
 Experience developing, releasing, and maintaining native Android applications (point us to your apps on Google Play)
 Communication abilities; you’re a specialist, and need to be able to communicate your work to folks with different specialties
 Perspective to understand how your work integrates into a larger, complex, heterogeneous system
  
 Bonus Points
  
  
 Specific experience bootstrapping new hardware in the past
 Experience developing for other deeply embedded or bare-metal platforms
  
 About the Team
  
 The Human Experience team is a multi-disciplinary team of devoted designers, mobile and robotics engineers working to deliver the highest quality user experience to vehicle operators and riders in Uber’s self-driving vehicles. Our work touches everything from industrial design, to hardware/electrical engineering, systems engineering, security, and application engineering.
