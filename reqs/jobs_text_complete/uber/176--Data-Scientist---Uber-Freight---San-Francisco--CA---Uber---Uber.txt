 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 We’re looking for experienced, passionate data scientists to work on our team. Specifically, we are looking for someone to build the pricing engine that will power Uber Freight.
  
 The marketplace dynamics group is all about the intersection of market signals and business strategy. Its mission is to ensure that Uber Freight has the data, processes, and tools to build and maintain a healthy marketplace. That means building quoting tools so that our Operations teams can bid and sell with confidence; that means building data structures to track the buy-offer-sell spreads of our freight; that means building a dynamically priced marketplace to ensure that our drivers are the most fairly paid in the industry.
 What You'll Do
  
 You'll be partnering with Uber's product and engineering teams to drive actionable data insights and solutions from some of the world's most interesting datasets. Our data scientists work on every aspect of the product - whether it's exploratory research to understand user behavior for riders and drivers, or running experiments to optimize untapped areas of growth, or developing machine learning models to mitigate fraud on our platform. 
  
 What You'll Need
 Minimum 3 years practical data science or engineering work experience out of school, in the aforementioned domains
 Domain expertise in logistics, supply chain management, and freight.
 Strong quantitative background: MS or PhD preferred.
 Familiarity with technical tools for analysis - Python (with Pandas, etc.), R, SQL
 Programming chops - demonstrable familiarity (work experience, Github account) with programming concepts. Go or Python skills and previous software engineering background a plus.
 Organizational skills and the ability to execute and own a complete research project -  go from idea to experimentation to prototype to implementation.
 Driven and focused self-starters, great communicators, amazing follow-through - you aggressively tackle your work and love the responsibility of being individually empowered.
 Scrappy, Entrepreneurial mindset - you’re comfortable making do with what you have and building toward the future.
  
 About the Team
  
 Trucks move everything you buy, why shouldn’t booking a truck be as seamless as booking an Uber?
  
 Uber Freight connects shippers with truckers, much like the way the Uber connects riders and drivers. The Uber Freight team believes that empowering truck drivers will bring more open, efficient, and increasingly safer transportation to our roads.
  
 We are a team of sharp, entrepreneurial individuals who are redefining the movement of goods around the world. We are currently looking for candidates to join our growing team who share our enthusiasm for tackling today’s toughest challenges in transportation.
