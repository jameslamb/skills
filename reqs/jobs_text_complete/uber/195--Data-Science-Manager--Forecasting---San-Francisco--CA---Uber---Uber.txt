 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the role
 The Marketplace team is looking for an experienced, passionate data science manager to lead and scale a functional team devoted to supply and demand forecasting.  Forward projections of drivers and riders, across multiple timescales and varying levels of spatial granularity, are crucial building blocks for Uber’s pricing and supply positioning systems.  Creating and updating these forecasts in response to a rapidly changing world is a fascinating and challenging problem, which must be solved in real time leveraging enormous data sets.
 About the Team
 Within Uber, the Marketplace organization focuses on achieving market balance, matching the supply of drivers with demand from riders, and building the technology to optimize the reliability and availability of Uber's trip fulfillment.  We are the brain of Uber, tackling the company’s most challenging quantitative problems: optimizing Uber's dynamic pricing system; providing real time positioning guidance to drivers; optimizing dispatches of drivers and couriers to incoming requests; matching riders together for UberPool, and many more.
  
 What You'll Need
 Excellent educational background in statistics, applied math, computer science, operations research, economics, or a related field.  Masters or PhD degree preferred.
 At least 5 years industry experience in time series modeling or machine learning, with significant personal experience as a technical contributor.  Experience working with large data sets; experience with spatial data a plus.
 At least 3 years experience as a frontline manager, leading teams of 5 or more.  As manager, you will manage several direct reports initially and will have the opportunity to create, scale and nourish a team of experienced professionals.
 Entrepreneurial. Everywhere you go, you can't help but mobilize people, create things, resolve problems, roll up your sleeves, collaborate, go above and beyond. You are an insatiable doer and motivator of others.
 Excellent execution and organization. This team will be working with engineers and product leads at the forefront of the development cycle. To excel in this role, you should be comfortable executing with little oversight and be able to adapt to problems quickly.
 Strategic mindset - you're comfortable thinking a few steps ahead of where the team is now and foreseeing new opportunities and challenges before others see them.
 Experience with common analysis tools - SQL, R, and Python. Demonstrable familiarity with code and programming concepts.
