 About Uber
  
 Uber is a technology company that is changing the way the world thinks about transportation. We are building technology people use everyday. Whether it's heading home from work, getting a meal delivered from a favorite restaurant, or a way to earn extra income, Uber is becoming part of the fabric of daily life.
  
 We're making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. And we're doing it at a global scale-energizing local economies and bringing opportunity to millions of people around the world.
  
 Uber's positive impact is tangible in the communities we operate in, and that drives us to keep moving forward.
 The reforms needed are relatively simple: the right for one citizen to drive another citizen across town so long as certain important consumer protections requirements are met. The idea is not all that radical. But in many cities outdated regulations are holding back progress-and in places where reform has been possible, entrenched interests often try to turn the clock back.
 Our public policy team is responsible for working with policy makers and third parties to make the positive case for change. That's partly about fostering lasting relationships in the cities where we operate with politicians and their staff so they understand the benefits of this new model. It's also about figuring out the best local regulatory framework and then developing campaigns to push reform through.
 We are looking for someone to Head our Public Policy team in India, based out of Gurgaon, Haryana
  
 What You'll Do
  
 Establish Uber's brand and profile with policy makers-including governments, third parties and academics; and
 Work to ensure that the regulatory framework in India supports ride-sharing apps like Uber.
 What you'll need
 A self starter: Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up. Stuff changes fast in our world so you'll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure.
 A great advocate: We're looking to create new regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and alternatives to individual car ownership. You'll need the intellectual rigor to grasp complex policy issues as well as the ability to articulate clearly and simply how apps like Uber can help improve transportation for everyone-both orally and in writing.
 A gifted campaigner: Smartphone apps are disruptive, and the interests being disrupted are deeply entrenched. So you'll need to put together proactive campaigns involving passengers, drivers and third parties that demonstrate there's a better alternative to today's outdated status quo. That means having a bias for action in everything you do-and a willingness to engage in debates, that can often become heated.
 A team player: Success at Uber depends on the ability to organize different teams (internally and externally) around shared goals. It's why we're looking for well organized people who enjoy working with others to get things done-and who can deal with the ambiguity that sometimes comes from working cross-functionally.
 Ideally you would have at least 8 years of experience in government affairs and policy. We are open to people who have experience in other areas, have a deep understanding of these issues and may be looking for a career change. Indian language skills are preferred, and fluency in English, both oral and written, is essential.
