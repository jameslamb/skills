 About Uber
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
 The Greenlight manager will lead the charge in building a best in class customer service experience for them. You'll manage your team of Greenlight Experts, Fleet Advisers and Telemarketing Experts, to onboard partners, resolve support issues efficiently and comprehensively and treat every support interaction as an opportunity to build a better connection between Uber, Lion City Rentals and the driver community.
 What You’ll Do
 Owning the success metrics for customer satisfaction and facility operational and financial performance
 Driving performance improvements through process development and innovation
 Hiring, training, and managing Greenlight Experts, Fleet Advisers and Telemarketing Experts
 Collecting and reporting on performance data
 Maintaining an awesome experience in our support centre
 Cultivating the global Uber brand and augmenting it with local details
  
 What You’ll Need
 Bachelor’s degree with 3-5 years of relevant experience
 Call center management, service team, retail or other customer service experience strongly preferred
 Solid verbal and written communication skills
 Leadership in Customer Service - You'll need truly world-class people skills to be able to influence partners as well as your team to deliver the Uber growth goals. Depending on the conversation, you’ll need to be able to charm or cajole our partners accordingly and coach our enthusiastic team of Greenlight Experts, Fleet Advisers and Telemarketing Experts.
 Analytical ability - We take an intensely data-driven approach to running our business. In order to efficiently manage the partner support centre you’ll be creating metrics to measure impact of your teams face-to-face interactions and use our data to make the right, operational decisions.
 Process driven. You have superior organizational skills, and constantly look to rejig things to make them more efficient. You question ‘why’ and seek to upskill to improve outcomes for our partners and the business.
 Business instincts - Inherently curious by nature, you enjoy thinking about what makes different businesses tick. You’re comfortable managing a P&L and reporting on metrics which show the success of your management decisions.
