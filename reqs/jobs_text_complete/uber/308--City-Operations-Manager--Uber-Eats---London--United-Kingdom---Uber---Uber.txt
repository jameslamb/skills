 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 The London City Operations Manager role is a unique opportunity to have a direct impact on the success of Uber Eats’ largest global city. The City Ops Manager will support the Market Lead for London by developing a deep, quantitative understanding of local market dynamics, jumping on challenges as they emerge and owning strategic projects.
  
 This role calls for a combination of savvy analytics, strategic thinking, strong execution and the interpersonal ability to work with teams from across the business. Further, as Uber Eats is a new business and remains a fast paced environment, we are looking for a highly adaptable candidate who is able to switch between long-term strategic initiatives one moment and pivot into rapid, tactical actions the next.
