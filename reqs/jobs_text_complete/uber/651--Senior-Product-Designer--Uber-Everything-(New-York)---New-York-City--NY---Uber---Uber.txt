 Senior Product Designer, Uber Everything (New York)
 Design in New York City, NY
 Apply Now
 Uber is evolving the way the world moves. By seamlessly connecting riders to drivers through our apps, we make cities more accessible, opening up more possibilities for riders and more business for drivers. With Uber Everything we’re building Uber’s next set of businesses; whether it’s delivering food within 10 minutes with UberEATS or sending things across town with UberRUSH, you will be involved in some of the new exciting business lines coming out of Uber. If done right, we believe that this will transform communities, power businesses and fundamentally change the way people live in a city.
 As a senior designer on the Uber Everything team in NYC, you’ll tackle tough challenges that cut across our business, consumer, and driver experiences, and you’ll help unlock world-changing new experiences. You’ll work among design-oriented engineers, product managers and some of the best designers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.
  
 We are highly user-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands great execution, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness and optimism to be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the user in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.
  
 We might be a good match if...
 You’re a generalist with a sweet spot, or a specialist looking to broaden your skills
 You focus on UI, UX, or you’re a mythical unicorn. We’re interested in talented designers first, titles a distant second.
  
 You believe in craftsmanship and create elegant and compelling designs, over and over.
 Your portfolio has some best-in-class work. You're a walking encyclopedia of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better.
  
 You’ve shipped product.
 You’ve weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, how to motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right, how to translate insights from user studies into meaningful action, and what’s most likely to go afoul at each stage. You can share several shining examples of real work you've shipped, and what you learned along the way.
  
 You substantially contribute to defining the 'what' as well as the 'how'.
 You're a product manager's secret weapon. You thrive best when helping to define the requirements, not just translating them into designs. You facilitate and draw the best design ideas from teammates.
  
 You can think and talk about the bottom line.
 Analytics don’t scare you, and you know which features can act as force multipliers on your company’s business model.
  
 Prototyping is a key part of your toolset.
 You’ve prototyped on multiple platforms. You’ve made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.
  
 Cross-platform is your style.
 Hopefully you’ve shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn’t, or why you’d opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android.
 PERKS:
 Employees are given Uber credits every month.
 The rare opportunity to change the world such that everyone around you is using the product you built. We’re not just another social web app, we’re moving real people and assets and reinventing transportation and logistics globally.
 Sharp, motivated co-workers in a fun office environment.
  
 BENEFITS (U.S.):
 401(k) plan, gym reimbursement, nine paid company holidays.
 Full medical/dental/vision package to fit your needs.
 Unlimited vacation policy; work hard and take time when you need it.
  
 We're bringing Uber to every major city in the world. We need brains and passion to make it happen and to make it happen in style.
