 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 We are looking for an exceptional data analyst who lives and breathes data. Our mission is to empower Uber with actionable insights and solve problems with data tools, dashboarding, and analysis.

 Work from inception of a specified business problem to delivery of a solution

 Effectively communicate data methodology and results to a diverse set of stakeholders.
 Write queries, contribute to larger scale products/projects and perform ad hoc analyses as needed
 What You’ll Need

 Superior attention to detail, team player, and organization
