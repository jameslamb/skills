 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the women and men who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About The Role
  
 In this role you will work with teams across the company to develop a cohesive approach to accessibility — identifying key priorities and driving decision-making and strategy. This means everything from the accessibility of our rider and driver apps, to how we partner with drivers operating wheelchair accessible vehicles. You will also be responsible for building and executing our accessibility product roadmap, and will lead a team of dedicated accessibility engineers to help ensure all features and products are built with accessibility in mind.
 What You'll Do
  
 • Help define the future of accessibility at Uber to ensure we’re fulfilling our mission of providing transportation as reliable as running water everywhere, for everyone.
 • Lead the accessibility technology roadmap from end-to-end, scoping out and working with a team of Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers to build new features and offerings to meet the needs of the riders and drivers who use our products.
 • Be a face for Uber in the accessibility community in San Francisco and nationally. You should help put Uber on the global map as an accessibility technology leader.
 • Represent the accessibility team in communication across the company and help ensure accessibility is viewed as priority in all functions
 • Review existing Uber features and provide feedback to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies
 • Ensure that Uber’s engineering teams have the knowledge and tools to build accessibility into their own products and provide support where necessary
  
 What You'll Need
  
 • A computer science undergraduate degree is highly preferred
 • Experience in and a passion for accessibility and assistive technologies
 • Ability to be a strong internal and external advocate for Uber’s accessibility agenda. You should be comfortable speaking publicly.
 • Expertise with assistive technologies (e.g. VoiceOver, TalkBack, screen readers), and in optimizing web and native applications for their use
 • Detailed knowledge of accessibility guidelines (such as WCAG 2.0) and technologies
 • Minimum of 4 years of Product Management, Technical Program Management, Data Engineering, and/or Data Science experience
 • Strong project management skills and the ability to work cross-functionally to engage stakeholders in a broader vision
 • Experience building products from zero to first release with your fingerprints all over them
 • You know how to leverage data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
