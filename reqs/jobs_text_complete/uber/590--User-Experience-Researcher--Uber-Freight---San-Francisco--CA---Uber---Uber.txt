 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 Uber Freight connect shippers with truckers, much like the way the Uber connects riders and drivers. We are a team of sharp, entrepreneurial individuals who are redefining the movement of things around the world. On the Uber Freight team, we fiercely believe that our dedication to transportation technologies will bring more harmonious, highly efficient, and increasingly safer transportation logistics to our roads. We are currently looking for researchers to join our growing team who share our enthusiasm for taking on today’s toughest challenges in transportation.
  
 Uber Freight is seeking user experience researchers who aren’t afraid to take on the hairy, complex, and profitable business of trucking and turn it into something simple, thoughtful, and magical. Each member of our small team of researchers is responsible for driving qualitative and quantitative research activities across a variety of teams. Researchers should be comfortable juggling many research approaches to ensure the broader Uber Freight team is empowered with the right insights for product decisions.
