 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 WHO YOU ARE
  
 A lover of process and optimisation. 
 You will be scaling and building incident support processes for the Uber community. You're excited about the opportunity to create and experiment with support processes, and are willing and able to lead others to adopt and utilize them.
 Data­ driven and analytical in mindset
 . You know data is a means to an end and know the right questions to ask to drive to actionable outcomes. You can explain complex analysis and data to a variety of audiences in a digestible way. You can manipulate an Excel sheet like nobody's business. Bonus points if you have SQL, coding, or programming experience.
 Incredibly empathetic and understanding 
 of both riders and driver partners experiences. You will be a powerful advocate for Uber's users and should be obsessed with the community experience and laser-focused on safety.
 Cool and calm under pressure.
 This role will involve coordinating responses to complex and sensitive incidents. As such, you have superior organisational skills, integrity, and great follow-through on tasks.
 Naturally curious. 
 You will use your investigative prowess and internal tools to come to the right answer.
 Word­savvy.
 You're eloquent and able to strike the perfect tone, whether you're explaining a new policy to our internal customers, or riders and driver partners, explaining the importance of certain complicated metrics, or responding to support issues over email.
 You work hard and smart and will take the lead in a minimally structured environment. You are flexible with your time and willing to travel in order to get the job done.
