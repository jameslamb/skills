 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 We are seeking a sharp and highly-organized Tax Assistant to support the tax team and business as we continue to grow our global presence. This is an opportunity to work with a stellar team on the daily functions that are at the core of Uber. Basically, your job is to enhance our effectiveness by doing research, analysis and providing information management support to the team; representing the team to others and generally being amazing. Up for the task? Read on!
  
  
 WHAT YOU'LL DO:
 Provide the EMEA tax team support on everything they do. This includes organizing data, doing research on projects, processing and reviewing contracts before they get signed as well as documenting decisions made to fortify our risk management process.
 Handle confidential and non-routine information and facilitate communication between appropriate departments.
 Conserve teams time by reading, researching, and routing correspondence; drafting letters and documents; collecting and analyzing information; initiating telecommunications.
  
 WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR:
 2+ years of similar experience.
 Attention to Detail. Being right the first time matters a lot to us.
 Strong communication skills and ability to interact with internal and external partners.
 Work well under pressure in a fast paced environment.
 Superior organizational skills and great follow through on tasks.
 Be a problem solver at heart with a genuine interest in learning by helping.
 Hustle. The company depends on us to deliver quickly, across time zones, in multiple languages, and from locations all over the world. We need somebody not to keep the trains running on time, but to speed them up.
 Attitude. We work awfully hard and we’re having a blast doing it. This team believes what we’re doing is changing the world for the better, and we play to win.
 An interest in and passion for Uber.
