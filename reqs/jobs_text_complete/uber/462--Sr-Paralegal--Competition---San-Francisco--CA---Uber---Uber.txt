 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, we pride ourselves on the amazing team we’ve built. The driver behind all our growth, our bold and disruptive brand, and the game-changing technology we bring to market is the people that make Uber well, uber. Delivering a first class, on-demand transportation experience takes a critical eye for quality, and we want a paralegal who has the same critical eye. This addition to our team must be organized, experienced, and willing to take on the responsibility to make things happen. The paralegal will be based at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco, CA or Washington, DC and will report to the head of our competition team.
  
 The right person will be comfortable in an "all hands on deck" environment, has a "the buck stops here" mentality and can thrive in a startup culture. Is this you? Well then, keep reading!

 Support the growing competition law department
 Establish and maintain confidential files and record keeping systems
 Process documents
 Maintain and update legal library of resource materials
 Manage and organize our internal resources dedicated to keeping the business well-informed on critical competition issues
 Track competition activity across the company

 Some in-house experience preferred
 A./B.S. or paralegal certificate required
 Experience with in-depth research and discovery preferred
