 About us
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 Team Overview
  
 Maps are critical to Uber’s mission of making transportation reliable and efficient, and the Map Services team is looking for engineers who are as passionate about designing machine learning algorithms and applying them to solve complex problems that directly impact transportation of billions of people and goods. 
  
 Routing team is a part of Map services and owns the full stack of technologies that result in time (ETAs), distance and route line estimations starting from processing of GPS driver locations, to machine-learned ETA adjustments and sophisticated turn-by-turn instructions for navigation. Our consumers are all Uber services ranging from eyeball ETAs, Dispatch decisions, Pool Matching, Fare estimation and calculation, or driver app navigation.
  
 As a machine learning systems engineer you will be designing machine learning platforms and pipelines for training and running machine learning models that predict travel times, routes, traffic conditions, and everything that constitute to accurate ETAs. Accurate ETAs are the most critical part of Uber ecosystem as they define the efficiency of dispatch, profitability of upfront pricing, quality of Uber Pool match, reliability of EATs and overall user experience and reputation. This is your chance to develop cutting-edge technology that will make huge impact of the whole Uber efficiency!
 The team is based in San Francisco.
