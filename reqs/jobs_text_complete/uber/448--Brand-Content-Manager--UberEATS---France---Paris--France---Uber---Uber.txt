 Apply Now
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it. 
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 UberEATS launched in March 2016 in France and is now the most downloaded Food Delivery App with more than 1.5M downloads. We are now available in 11 cities, delivering from over 3,000 restaurants and growing quickly!
 UberEATS delivers the best of your city right when you want it. Our curated menus feature dishes from the local spots you love and the ones you’ve always wanted to try. It’s the same cashless payment as an Uber ride. You just have to tap the app and get your food delivered right to your doorstep and enjoy!
  
 The ideal candidate will have a track record of writing and producing
  compelling content that captivates users through every stage of the customer journey for email, SMS, the web and beyond.

 marketing team

 What you'll do:
  
 Storytelling, brand, and content - own the UberEATS brand in your city, create compelling stories for our audience, and help drive more users into the funnel.
 Partner with creative strategists, marketing managers and visual designers to plan and write digital content for customers in France.
 Craft compelling copy and help build a narrative together with our CRM team.
 Manage content across the editorial cycle, including copywriting, measurement, and reporting.
