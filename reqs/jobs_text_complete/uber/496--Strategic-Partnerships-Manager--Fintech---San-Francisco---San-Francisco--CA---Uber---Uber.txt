 About Uber
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

 Manage and scale current partnerships to deliver meaningful contribution to Uber. Expand next-phase impact of these long-term partners, support their evolution by creating and playbooking new ways to globally scale, and kick off new product initiatives (e.g. what’s next after launch & validation in the US)
 Partner with City Teams as necessary to activate partnership marketing and impactful campaigns
 What you'll need
 Minimum 6 experience in (technical) program management OR product management OR management consulting, with at least 2 years of partner/account management or business development experience.
