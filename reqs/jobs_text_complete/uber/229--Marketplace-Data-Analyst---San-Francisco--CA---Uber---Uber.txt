 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 The Marketplace team builds the platform, products, and algorithms responsible for the optimization of Uber's marketplace focused on pricing, positioning and matching for all rideshare and UberEverything products. Our group’s systems control the dynamics of all of Uber’s markets, from deciding rider promotion structures to dispatching the best driver on the network in real time.
