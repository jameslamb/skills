 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 At Uber, providing amazing support that establishes trust for riders and driver partners—our community—is a core feature of our product experience. We invest in it and believe in providing the highest quality service executed in the smartest, most efficient way. We’re looking for a Learning Manager to work alongside our Global Community Operations team and own the building and content of our learning program. This multi-faceted role requires quick thinking and proficiency in building learning plans, as well as an overall knack for interaction and in-person training. Our Community Operations Managers and Community Support Teams are all about process efficiency, and as a Learning Manager, you would be ensuring that these teams of rockstars are able to continuously provide world class support to everyone involved in the Uber experience. This role is about building a solid foundation for our learning modules, scaling it beyond what is today, and pre-empting what it will need to be tomorrow.
 What You’ll Do
 Work cross functionally to improve Community Support Representatives’ (CSRs) learning experience and knowledge of internal and external tools and products 
 Facilitate learning programs to develop participants' competences and to help learners meet specified performance expectations 
 Modify training programs, as necessary, to ensure consistency with Uber culture and quality standards 
 Collaborate with the contact center’s leadership team regarding training needs, curriculum design, development, and delivery in order to create relevant solutions for the business 
 Monitor linkage between curriculum and improved learner job performance, and coach participants back on the job, ensuring that learning translates to performance, and conduct additional research prior to leading change initiatives 
 Evaluate learning and use evaluation and feedback to upgrade learning and/or develop additional material 
 Ensure learning schedules and calendars are administered and maintain participant records during training. 
 Build an efficient and scalable learning program that facilitates the evolution of our support system and customers (both internal and external) 
 Be a passionate advocate for your global Community Operations organization by owning the learning development of their support team 
 Be available to work on evenings and weekends, variable schedule(s) as necessary to meet demands of the business
 What You’ll Need
 Bachelor’s degree required 
 Prior professional experience in a Training or Learning environment, including knowledge of adult learning theories 
 Outstanding project management skills 
 Exceptional verbal/written communication skills 
 Previous experience with customer support is a nice bonus, but not required
