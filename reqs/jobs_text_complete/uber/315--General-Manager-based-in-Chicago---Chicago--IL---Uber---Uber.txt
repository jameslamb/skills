 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 As a General Manager, you are responsible for operational excellence, extending the Uber brand locally and developing the next generation of Uber talent. Working cross functionally with our central marketing, policy and communication teams will be crucial to your success in this role. Continual improvement and a quality focus are the name of the game. We believe in solving local problems, so understanding your market and delivering custom messages is important. 
 It’s the cross of the analytical with the creative problem solving that makes the Uber GM an incredibly difficult job to fill. If you’re potentially one of the truly rare, gifted Uber GMs, we want to hear from you!
 What You'll Do:
 Lead a core operations team based in Chicago
  
 Work closely with the Midwest subregional leadership team to drive the strategy for the entire subregion
  
 Actively reinforce the cultural tone of the Chicago office for the operations team
  
 Build and develop strong relationships with senior cross-functional leaders (e.g., Central Ops, S&P, Marketing, Public Affairs, People Ops, CommOps, Greenlight, Legal/Regulatory, Finance) in order to successfully drive the long-term growth of Midwest
  
 Develop the next generation of leaders at Uber
  
  
 What You'll Need:
 7+ years of large team management experience with a proven track record of managing managers
  
 MBA strongly preferred
  
 Strong people management skills - you can set the tone for your team; driving towards results while also being empathetic to their challenges - EQ is a must-have
  
 Data-driven decision mentality and sound business judgment through strong analytical thinking
