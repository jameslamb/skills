 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 Passionate about high-growth startups and have strong analytical skills? Are you a proven team player, strategic thinker, and executor? Do you live and breathe to turn raw data into meaningful business information? Then let’s talk.
  
 As a Regional Business Analyst on Uber’s APACx Analytics team, you will help drive the analysis behind company-wide decisions related to operations, process, and optimization. The ideal candidate for this role should have strong analytical skills, excellent time-management and organizational habits, and the ability to clearly communicate and present information.
 What you'll do
  
 Drive analytics on region-spanning projects and important strategic decisions
 Coordinate with other members of the Regional Operations Teams to measure the impact and efficiency of new products and business processes
 Develop analytical frameworks to support the company in new markets and products
 Identify operational weaknesses and help improve or innovate new processes to keep local teams as efficient as possible
 Build, maintain, and communicate detailed reporting models to assist city-level, regional, and global operations managers
  
 What you'll need
  
 BA/BS/Masters in Economics, Business, Engineering, or other quantitative focus
 1-5 years of investment banking / consulting / analytical or related experience; high-growth analytics or operations experience a plus
 Strong communication and organization skills
 Team player
 Balance attention to detail with swift execution - we need to do things quickly, and we need to do them well. Balancing those can be challenging, and this should be a strength
 Explorer - the ability to self-serve, investigate and get the data we require will make you much more effective in this role. Self-starter attitude is a must!
 Exceptional Excel / data management skills - many say they are great at Excel, fewer truly are. Ideal candidate brings some impressive know-how (and the understanding that there’s always more to learn)
 SQL experience preferred
 About the team
  
 The APAC Analytics & Insights team works with regional partners across functions to drive data-driven strategic and operational decision-making. We do this by developing high-impact tools and analyses as well as performing deep dives and quantitative research on different areas of the business. 
 The team ensures consistent analytical rigor and fosters synergy across business lines by being embedded within the Transport, EATS, Marketing, Strategy, and CommOps businesses.
