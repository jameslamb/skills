 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 The successful candidate will be an expert with analyzing large data sets, enjoys diving deep into data analysis, discovering root causes, and designing long-term solutions. Additionally, the candidate should be an effective communicator capable of independently driving issues to resolution and communicating insights to non-technical audiences.
 What You’ll Do
 You will be designing, building and launching deeply efficient & reliable data pipelines to move and process big data.
 Conduct deep-diving data analysis for business insights and recommendation
 Collaborate with software engineers to implement the data architecture and design
  
 What You’ll Need
 Proficiency with SQL. We have a number of different SQL-based systems in use: MySQL, Postgres, Hive, and Vertica.
 Programming in Python. Most of our pipelines and analysis are done in Python.
 Familiarity with other languages like Go, Java, or Scala. Many of the systems we work with are developed in other languages and require code to be written or maintained in those languages. If you don’t know those languages already, you’ll have the space to learn them.
 You should have familiarity with distributed data systems like Spark, Cassandra, and Hadoop.
 Experience building data models and visualizations that provide intuitive analytics to your customers
 You should be comfortable moving across multiple teams in high visibility roles.
