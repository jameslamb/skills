 About Uber
 

 

 Uber is a technology company that is changing the way the world thinks about transportation. We are building technology people use everyday. Whether it's heading home from work, getting a meal delivered from a favorite restaurant, or a way to earn extra income, Uber is becoming part of the fabric of daily life.
 

 

 We're making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. And we're doing it at a global scale-energizing local economies and bringing opportunity to millions of people around the world. 
 

 

 Uber's positive impact is tangible in the communities we operate in, and that drives us to keep moving forward.
 We are seeking smart, personable, and highly organized Onboarding Specialists to support our Los Angeles city team as we continue to grow our presence. This is a non-staff position, based in our Los Angeles office. We need people with excellent communication and problem-solving skills, a logical, process-driven mindset, and a go-getter attitude. You'll be expected to help onboard new restaurants, train them to be great partners, and quickly adapt in an ever-growing business. This is truly an opportunity to work with a stellar operations team and gain invaluable experience at the ground floor of a fast growing, high impact tech organization.
 

 

 What you'll do
 

 Coordinate and execute the restaurant on boarding process (e.g. setting up system profiles, photography scheduling, creating and curating the menu the restaurant will show in the app)
 Provide excellent customer service and support for these new restaurant partners
 Work with the Restaurant Operations team to streamline processes
 Step up and be a go getter to ensure our business is successful: whether that's working extra hard to get those last few restaurants set up or cold calling new restaurants to help create our pipeline, you're ready and willing to put in that extra effort to make the business successful.
 

 

 What you'll need
 

 At least 1 year of customer service experience
 You have a pleasant, personable manner - people like working with you
 You thrive in a fast-paced environment with well-defined goals, but ambiguity on how to get there
 You are a logical thinker, who naturally looks to create efficient processes where there are none
 You are Self-driven and a great team player
 You are tech savvy
 You are highly organized and detail-oriented
 

 Compensation: Hourly
