 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next. 
 The Role | Driver Growth and Funnel
  
 Onboarding new drivers is the lifeblood that powers Uber’s striking growth and creates a path to economic empowerment for millions of people every year. Your work helps those who need it most: millions of drivers use Uber to meet financial needs at all points on the continuum, from putting food on the table, to generating spending money during grad school, to saving up for a special vacation.
 Serving drivers with these different needs & objectives, and considering a global scope, your role is complex and broad. As the PM lead of this team you will develop and execute on the vision, strategy and roadmap that enables anyone in the world to try driving, from signup to their first trip. You will also create an extensible platform that simplifies this process while creating a delightful experience for people across all our product lines (Ridesharing, Delivery, Freight and others in the future). You are highly customer obsessed, deep into data and user research, and excel at leading a talented team of engineers, designers, data scientists and others to deliver on this mission.

 Drive cross-functional team to set qualitative objectives and quantitative goals
 Drive innovation, definition, deliverables planning (roadmap) and design of entirely new Uber products and product features to deliver against team and company goals. Requires challenging all members of cross-functional team (engineering, design, etc.) to think boldly and creatively and then to funnel that energy into concrete products and execution plans.
