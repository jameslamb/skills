 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About The Role
 Our Operations teams are the heart and soul of Uber Freight. The Carrier Operations Associate Manager role has a direct impact on the growth and optimization of the carrier population on Uber Freight’s platform, continually improving the carrier experience through easier access to high quality freight, while minimizing hassles and streamlining processes. This data-driven management role calls for a rare combination of analytical thinking, management experience and interpersonal ability to manage relationships with a very valuable part of our business; our carriers. This person will manage a team of operations and data analysts to build up an engaged driver base, and create a marketplace to match shippers and carriers through our Uber Freight App. This role is ultimately responsible for making sure we have carriers and liquidity in the marketplace, driving growth to the business through app utilization and efficient processes.

 Develop & Optimize Processes. Take big picture ideas and break them into actionable steps with aggressive timelines for completion.  
 Stakeholder Management. Carrier Operations sits in the middle of various teams. Getting buy-in and aligning teams is key to a smooth operation.
