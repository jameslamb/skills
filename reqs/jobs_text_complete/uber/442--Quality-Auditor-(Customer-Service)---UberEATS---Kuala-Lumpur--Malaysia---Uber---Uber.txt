 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 ABOUT THE JOB
  
 At Uber, we are all about providing amazing support that establishes trust for riders and partners. We invest in it and believe in providing the highest quality service executed in the smartest, most efficient way.
  
 Community Operations (CommOps) are all about helping and educating both riders and drivers. COSes help people resolve their issues and turn unhappy users into our strongest evangelists. The Quality Auditor ensures that customer support representatives (CSRs) are providing a consistently excellent quality of support to all our customers - no matter where they are from or what LOB they are in.
  
 The right candidate for the Quality Auditor position is a subject matter expert who knows everything there is to know about their line of businesses (LOBs), and is passionate about delivering world-class support by helping produce flawless customer interactions every time. The QA will spend time examining tickets and contacts, determining the root causes of any points of failure and addressing them. Utilizing their on-the-ground support experience and careful eye for detail, this candidate will help ensure an excellent support experience for our riders and partners, while improving the performance of customer support representatives.
