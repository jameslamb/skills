 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, providing world-class customer support to riders and driver partners is a core feature of our product experience. Delivering this caliber of support isn’t easy - it takes leaders who can understand Uber’s operations, adapt to our constantly changing business, and help solve problems where no solution currently exists.
  
 We’re looking for a program manager to join the Incident Response Team who will help unite our safety support programs globally. You will be reporting into the Global IRT Program Leader and be responsible for managing the alignment of our regional programs, leading cross-regional projects, helping to define and standardize process improvements, and much more. This will produce better safety outcomes for our customers and more consistent data for the Safety team to use in building innovative products. This will be a project management role with a heavy focus on cross functional collaboration, regional calibration, and process improvement through data analytics, organization, and teamwork.
 What You’ll Do
  
 Coordinate and motivate across teams within a time-sensitive environment to enable delivery on operational KPIs
 Influence and enforce standardization around the globe in the way that we address critical safety incidents
 Analyze the performance, identify trends, and propose projects to improve processes and enable better performance of the Safety Support program 
 Drive continuous process improvement to deliver a world-class experience 
 Be a critical thought partner to regional and global leadership in developing a best-in-class experience for the customer
  
 What You’ll Need
  
 Minimum of 3 years of managing cross-functional projects, stakeholders, and actionable insights
 Self motivated with a strong affinity for problem solving
 Demonstrated success in using data to make customer focused decisions and to facilitate behavior change in support organizations
 Exceptional written and verbal communication skills across multiple functions and teams -- a natural storyteller and consensus builder
 Experience with process optimization, program management, customer support strategy, or quality assurance
  
 About the Team
  
 Community Operations is pioneering how Uber manages rider and driver partner support around the globe. This role will help unite our safety support programs globally.
