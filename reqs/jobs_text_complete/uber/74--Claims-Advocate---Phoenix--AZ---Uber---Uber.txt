 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
  
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, Insurance is an integral part of our business -- it dictates our ability to operate, expand into new geographies, and open new lines of business.  Our Uber Claims Advocates likewise have a key role in driving the success of our operations.  Working in collaboration with our insurance carrier partners, Claims Advocates help ensure that we are delivering exceptional service to our partner drivers and customers.

 The role interacts with claimants, drivers, passengers, attorneys, insurers, and third party claims administrators throughout the claims management process.

 Advocate on behalf of partner drivers, customers and claimants to ensure they are receiving exceptional claims service;
 Manage an inventory of claims to ensure proper claims handling throughout the life of the claim in collaboration with our insurance carrier partners;
 Engage in claims roundtable discussions with insurance carrier partners; 
 Establish and monitor claims action plans to ensure carrier claims handling fulfills obligations per regulatory requirements and Uber expectations; and 
 Actively participate in global Claims projects/initiatives to drive Uber’s success.

 Bachelor's Degree or equivalent;

 Strong written and verbal communication skills;
 Strong analytical and problem-solving skills;
