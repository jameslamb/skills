 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role 
  
 The General Manager is one of the most demanding positions Uber has to offer; it requires a unique combination of talent, courage, and leadership. As the leader of Uber in each region, the RGM is responsible for the development and sustainable growth of our business and people.
  
 The core of Uber is in our cities, working together with country and regional teams, led by a Regional General Manager. They make the magic that is Uber a reality. It’s a big deal, and the qualities and capabilities required of an Uber RGM mean you are an incredibly intelligent, talented, and highly sought-after professional.
  
 This is first and foremost a role for a strong, analytical marketer, focusing on reaching new users and extending the Uber brand in a relevant and thoughtful way across local markets. As the RGM, you’ll also be responsible for operational excellence and maintaining and continuously improving ‘Uber’ quality throughout the Rider’s experience, customer support, local marketing, supply chain management, service quality management, social media and PR.
  
 This role requires excellent collaboration across different functional and specialised teams, and can bridge the gap with city, Regional, and HQ teams. We need leaders that are visionaries and can build, coach and inspire high performing teams to reach their potential. We believe in solving local problems with local solutions, so understanding your market and delivering custom messages is important.
  
 It’s the intersection of the analytical with the creative that makes the Uber GM an incredibly difficult job to fill and the impact on our people and our business that make it such a great job to have!
