 About Uber
  
 Uber is a technology company that is changing the way the world thinks about transportation. We are building technology people use everyday. Whether it's heading home from work, getting a meal delivered from a favorite restaurant, or a way to earn extra income, Uber is becoming part of the fabric of daily life.
  
 We're making cities safer, smarter, and more connected. And we're doing it at a global scale-energizing local economies and bringing opportunity to millions of people around the world.
  
 Uber's positive impact is tangible in the communities we operate in, and that drives us to keep moving forward.
 Uber Design Research is seeking an experienced manager to lead a group of researchers focused on our applications and services.
  
 Beneath our apps is an internationally diverse world of amazing cities, transportation logistics, market making, and interactions among drivers, riders, and businesses.
  
 We're also here for personal reasons. We want to turn cities from grey to green. We aim to replace parking with parks.
  
 If you're a great manager, comfortable in a high-velocity environment, and unafraid to push the limits, we'd love to talk with you.
