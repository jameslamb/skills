 About Uber 
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 The
  
 Uber
  
 Advanced
  
 Technology
  
 Group
 ; a culture of opportunities marked by rapid-growth and high-productivity. We focus on the development of key long-term technologies that advance Uber’s mission of bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere.
 Uber Advanced Technologies Group is developing next generation mapping, vehicle safety, and autonomy technologies. As part of this effort, we’re building a small group of uniquely talented and thoughtful designers to define the next generation platform and tooling that supports a variety of high-reaching initiatives.

 About Us
 We’re
  
 fierce
  
 truth-seekers
 . The problems we’re pursuing are some of the most difficult problems in the industry. We’re constantly iterating and working to translate insights and complexity into high-quality, elegant products.
 Data

 craftsmanship.

 Prototyping
  
 is
  
 a
  
 key
  
 part
  
 of
  
 our
  
 toolset.
