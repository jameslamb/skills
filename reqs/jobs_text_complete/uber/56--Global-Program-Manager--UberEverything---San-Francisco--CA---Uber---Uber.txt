 About Uber 
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 At Uber, providing world-class customer support for all of our products is a core feature of our experience.

This is a project management role with a heavy focus on cross-functional collaboration, regional calibration, and process improvement through alignment, teamwork, organization and data analysis.
  
 Delivering the caliber of customer support we expect isn’t easy—it takes leaders who can understand Uber’s operations, adapt to our constantly changing business, and help solve problems where no solution currently exists.

 Self-motivated with a strong affinity for vision setting, strategic problem solving and driving action
 Persuasive written and verbal communication skills across diverse functions and teams
