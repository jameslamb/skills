 About Uber:
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role:
  
 We are looking for a Marketing Executive (Contractual role) for UberEATS, Uber's new food delivery app to assist with digital marketing, on ground activations, partnerships, liaising with multiple stakeholders, restaurant marketing & much more.

 Lead on-ground activations with agencies and promoters to ensure a successful deployment of an offline campaign
 Connect with influencers throughout the value chain to promote the brand
 Work with the Account Management team to help market restaurants to our users
 Work with multiple teams like Design, Legal, Tax, BD and many more to get partnerships & campaigns live.
 What You’ll Need:
  
 Candidate should have completed their bachelor's degree
 Good communication, decision making, analytical and problem solving skills
 Self-driven, integrity and great follow through on tasks. Person shouldn't get overwhelmed easily.
 The ability to create and curate good content for UberEATS users via in-app and social channels
