 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 We are currently searching for a high calibre transactions counsel to help manage our commercial transactions needs at an EMEA level. You will be based at Uber’s international headquarters in Amsterdam. However, you’ll also be expected to be willing to travel across the region where needed. 
  
 WHAT YOU'LL DO
  
 Work closely with our EMEA team and other members of the legal department globally on commercial transactions, corporate and product matters across the region. 
 Act as a point of contact on transactions issues for the business in Amsterdam as well as for teams at our global HQ in San Francisco and assist our regional legal teams working on similar issues as needed.
 Be an active partner, and ensure the provision of timely business-focused advice,  to a variety of business areas including product development, vehicle solutions, business development and Uber for Business. 
 Work on commercial contracts such as technology agreements, promotional agreements, sponsorships, partnerships as well as general procurement and marketing and advertising initiatives across the region
 With your team, be responsible for the efficient management of company secretarial issues for the region, ensuring timely filings. 
 You’ll take responsibility for ensuring we have the right processes and tools available to enable the team’s capability to scale as the business does.
 Provide strategic and proactive legal advice to internal business groups. It’s our job to peer round corners for the business and ensure that we are well positioned for the future.
 Effectively and efficiently manage outside counsel to achieve business objectives 
 Understand, interpret and apply current regulations as applicable to Uber’s business models in the region and your areas of responsibility.
 Work hard but have a lot of fun doing it!
