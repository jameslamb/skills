 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next. 
 The Role
  
 If you join the Uber Product team, you'll work among passionate engineers, designers and product managers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid technology/operations environment. We are highly user-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box. The role asks great technical depth, ethical thinking, well honed product judgment, a persevering refusal to settle, innovation, a high design standard and a mentality of starting with the user and working backwards.
  
  
 What you'll do
  
 As the Lead Product Marketing Manager for the Seattle team, you will develop a team of PMMs charged with envisioning and executing on a growth and go-to-market strategy for new products. You will develop a team that drives highly impactful growth programs to boost user acquisition, funnel conversion, user engagement, and lifetime value. You will work with each PMM to craft effective launch plans including messaging and pitch.
  
 Your performance will be measured by the growth the products in your purview, and your ability to collaborate closely with and enhance the productivity of a high-performing cross-functional team that includes counterparts in Design, Engineering, Business Development, and Operations.

 Communication skills: You can craft a compelling narrative across different channels - you know how to match the message to the medium
