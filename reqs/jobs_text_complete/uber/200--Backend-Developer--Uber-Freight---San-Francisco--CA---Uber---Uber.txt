 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 As a Backend Engineer at Uber, you’ll be working on code that’s closest to the business. Your work will impact live riders, eaters, driver-partners, and operations teams across the globe. Our teams span from the traditional ridesharing business to the new emerging products around UberEATS, our own Mapping technology, and Self-Driving cars.
  
 You will build user-facing products, handle and store thousands of payment transactions per second, and develop intelligent fraud prevention strategies that scale. From building maps that help move millions of people, to the messaging systems that let us interact with them - the work you do will impact every single Uber request.
 What You'll Do
  
 Carrier Experience
 The Carrier Experience team is a cross-functional team where Backend, Android and iOS engineers work together with design to build products we feel will provide better opportunities for truck drivers to maximize their revenue and flexibility. Our flagship product is a mobile application (available on iOS and Android) that helps Uber Freight's primary goal of automating the freight industry by giving drivers the ability to book their own loads and control their own schedules. We are a #driverobsessed team, and care deeply about our users and continually look for opportunities to improve their lives.
  
 Operations Experience
 The Operations Experience group aims to make every Uber Freight operations person a superhero. This means building fast, informative tools to speed up the workflows around creating, selling, and booking freight; it means becoming automation obsessed to maintain a lean, quality-obsessed organization even as we scale dramatically; it means building predictive models and alerting mechanisms so we can address loads at risk of operational failure before the problems ever happen.
  
 Marketplace Dynamics/Pricing
 The marketplace dynamics pricing group is all about the intersection of market signals and business strategy. Its mission is to ensure that Uber Freight has the data, processes, and tools to build and maintain a healthy marketplace. That means building intelligent pricing engine and quoting tools so that our Operations teams can bid and sell with confidence
  
 at scale
 ; that means building data structures to track the buy-offer-sell spreads of our freight; that means building a dynamic optimally ally priced marketplace to ensure that our drivers are the most fairly paid in the industry.
  
 Shipper Experience
 The Shipper Experience team is building tech to scale the demand for Uber Freight’s marketplace. The team is challenged with addressing diverse needs from the world's largest shippers to the smallest, and we are focused on replacing antiquated industry technology with open APIs, intelligent analytics, and reliable supply chain management and transparency.
  
 What You'll Need
  
 All Backend Developer Candidates:
 - BS/MS/Phd in Computer Science or related field required
 - Demonstrated experience of shipping high-quality product features on schedule
 - Experience in working on large-scale distributed systems
 - Data-driven architecture and systems design

 About the Team
  
 Trucks move everything you buy, why shouldn’t booking a truck be as seamless as booking an Uber?

The Uber Freight team believes that empowering truck drivers will bring more open, efficient, and increasingly safer transportation to our roads. We are a team of sharp, entrepreneurial individuals who are redefining the movement of goods around the world. We are currently looking for candidates to join our growing team who share our enthusiasm for tackling today’s toughest challenges in transportation.
