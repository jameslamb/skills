 About Uber
  
 We’re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we’re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it’s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
  
 For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
  
 And that’s just what we’re doing today. We’re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we’re in for the long haul. We’re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.
 About the Role
  
 As a controls systems engineer you will develop and implement real-time functionality for safety-critical embedded applications.
  
 What You'll Do
 Validate in-vehicle controller performance against functional requirements
 Analyze, sustain, and improve existing controls software.
 Collaborate with internal and external teams for efficient delivery using standard methodologies
  
 What You'll Need
 Understanding of control theory and experience with its vehicle systems applications
 Real-time control functionality implementation in C/C++
 Relevant Matlab/Simulink tools proficiency
 Proficiency in languages and tools such as Python, Vector
 Industrial experience (automotive preferred)
 Ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams
 Flexibility to take on tasks outside of own comfort zone – self starter in a dynamic work environment
 Engineering degree in a relevant field of study (control systems emphasis preferred)
  
 Bonus Points If
 Go-getter - We’re looking for team members who flourish by applying their knowledge, learning new technologies and don’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions
 You should be able to adapt easily to meet the rapid pace of a rapidly evolving research, development, and testing environment.
 Fearlessness - You think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point
 You strive on showing that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time
 Versatility - In addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance
 Passion - You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design "released" until you’re confident it’s correct
 You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage
 A great teammate -  You believe that you can achieve more on a team — that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
 You rely on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement
 Design and eye for business - You understand requirements beyond the written word and how your technical contributions will influence the viability of future products
 Whether you’re working on a software library used by other developers, a sensor to be retrofitted on a test vehicle, or a printed circuit to be mass produced, the other members of the team can depend on the quality of your work to rapidly advance our goals
  
 About the Team
  
 At the Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), we are building technologies that will transform the way the world moves. Our teams in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Toronto are dedicated to mapping, software and hardware development, vehicle safety, and operations for self-driving technology. Our teams are passionate about developing a self-driving system that will one day move people and things around more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively.
  
 The controls systems team strives to achieve the perfect harmony between software and hardware through efficient solutions to complex problems related to self driving, including controls theory, simulations and vehicle systems.
