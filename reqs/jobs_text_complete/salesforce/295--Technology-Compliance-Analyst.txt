						 Job Title: Technology Compliance Analyst Location: San Francisco, CA (HQ)  Role Description: About Salesforce: Salesforce is the global leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software. We pioneered the shift to cloud computing, and today we're delivering the next generation of social, mobile and cloud technologies that help companies revolutionize the way they sell, service, market and innovate-and become customer companies. We are the fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, the World's Most Innovative Company according to Forbes and one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our more human, less corporate culture is built around doing work that matters, winning as a team and celebrating success Aloha-style.

Your Impact: We are looking to hire an Analyst with IT audit, security, operations, and/or project management experience to help drive improvements within the TC team through the use of our Common Controls Framework (CCF) and the solutions used to manage and deliver the CCF for our audit programs.

The team's goal is to support all aspects of the Company's operations by partnering with the business to enhance key processes while enabling continuous compliance. The TC Analyst must be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, interfacing with colleagues at all levels of the organization, and serving as an ambassador for the Technology Compliance programs throughout Salesforce.
