 Salesforce is the #1 in CRM in the world, and best known as the Customer Success Platform.  As an industry leader in Sales, Service, and Marketing, we have some of the most unique data sets in the world.  With our customers we are trailblazing new ways to bring AI to their customers.  Whether it’s Service Technicians triaging their most urgent support tickets, or helping Retailers build deeper, more personalized relationships with each customer, or helping sales teams prioritize opportunities and win more deals. 
 

 Salesforce is looking for data scientists with hands on experience transforming unique data into amazing products. At scale.   
 

 A typical day for you might include some of the following:  

 Develop machine learning software and models that can generalize across hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers, but can automatically adapt to each of their individual features.

 Work with internal product teams to transform and sprinkle machine learning fairy dust on their products.  

 Build intelligence into our services to make them run smarter. 

 Participate in meal conversations with your team members about really important topics, such as: Should the cuteness of panda bears be a factor in their survivability? Is love a decision tree or a regression model? How far ahead would society be today if we had 12 fingers instead of 10?
