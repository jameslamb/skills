 The Security team at Salesforce is building a brand new platform for network segmentation and access control of inter-service communication. We are looking at a state-of-the-art framework that provides automated translation from user specifications of service access rules to various access control points in our cloud infrastructure where these rules are enforced. This control platform spawns different networking layers (from containers, VMs, physical servers and networking devices) and technologies (network segmentation, firewalls, hypervisor  

 and tenants controls). 
 

 This is a great opportunity for engineers that want a comprehensive technical growth as it involves developing skills on three coordinates: 

 - Security: experimenting with access control/packet filtering techniques and kernel modules, managing and monitoring communication among services. 

 - Networking: exploring and implementing solutions at various OSI layers and devices, from physical hosts to containers to network switches.   

 - Development: architecting and coding solutions at kernel/hypervisor level, as well as microservices in OOO languages (Golang, Python, etc.). 
 

            Responsibilities   

 
	 Designing and implementing networking access management solutions (software or hardware-based) across different technological stacks (physical devices, bare metal OS, hypervisors, VMs, Docker containers) in Salesforce’s private and public clouds 
	 
	 Optimizing access control management from policy declaration to enforcement points (network ACLs, host and device-based firewalls, etc.) 
	 
	 Researching and implementing new networking security solutions and platforms for service communication and access management (intra and inter-clouds, WAN) 
	 
	 Performing datacenter network architecture security assessments and architecting IaaS/PaaS platforms to harden security and availability posture 
	 
	 Developing and managing production services that support network security infrastructure in a full DevOps model 	 	  

	 Requirements 	  
	 
	 8+ years of technical experience, including: 

	 
		 3+ years experience in network security development 
		 
		 3+ years experience in a high-availability 24x7x365 environment (cloud platforms are a plus) 
		 
	 
	 Hands-on expertise in network security development, at one or more levels 

	 
		 Linux kernel: netfilter, nftables/iptables, BPF, XDP, netmap, ipsec 
		 
		 Hypervisor/Container controls: KVM modules, OpenStack (Neutron, Calico), Docker CNM 
		 
		 Security platforms: DDoS prevention, RBAC, VPC, VPN, IDS 
		 
		 Hardware: switch ACLs, stateful firewalls, network segmentation, security zones 
		 
	 
	 Proficiency in Unix/Linux systems (e.g., CentOS, RHEL, or similar) 	 	 	 Desired Skills/Experience 	  
	 
	 M.Sc/M.Eng in Computer Science/Engineering or B.A/B.Sc. in same disciplines with equivalent years of experience 
	 
	 Expertise in OSI model, networking investigations and tools (transport, routing and discovery protocols, packet inspection and flow troubleshooting) 
	 
	 Hands-on proficiency in building datacenter (security) network infrastructure, especially for large cloud IaaS (host bootstrap to data lifecycle, Clos architecture, PoPs) 
	 
	 Competence in software-based network technologies (SLB, SDN, VXLAN, VPN) 
	 
	 Experience working with systems from one or more of the following platforms:  

	 
		 Software: OpenStack, Docker, VMWare, Illumio 
		 
		 Hardware: Palo Alto, Fortinet, Arista, Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Force 10, F5 Networks, Gigamon. 
		 
	 
	 Proven track of building large-scale PaaS/IaaS, leveraging well-known distributed systems technologies (Paxos, Raft, Zookeeper, Kafka, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, etc.) 
	 
	 Command over high-availability design, including multi-site routing, peering, and disaster recovery applications and network architectures 
	 
	 DevOps mindset and full code ownership (design, code, test, deploy, monitor, maintain) 
	 
	 Automation/scripting skills for configuration management/monitoring (Puppet, bash ) 
	   
	 Competence in networking programming and debugging  
	 
	 Proficiency in at least one of the following programming languages: Golang, Java, C/C++, Python
