Software Engineer, Frontend (Regulator Platform)
 San Francisco, CA
 Full-time
 Company Description
 We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. So we’re building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all.  We started with a little white credit card reader but haven’t stopped there. Our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and NFC payments, and our Cash app lets people pay each other back instantly.   We’re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location.  Let’s shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.
 Job Description
 Regulator Platform builds and runs the common infrastructure, dashboard, and workflow management that allow Square employees (especially Support, Risk, and Compliance) to quickly research and resolve customer issues. Key parts of this project involve integrating with and corralling data from all of Square’s products to paint a coherent picture of Square’s customers as they exist now or existed at a point in time, and then arranging all the actions that can be taken in order to resolve an issue.
 We care about a solid, scalable, efficient, and straightforward UX for the hundreds of Squares who use our team’s internal products daily. At the same time, to keep up with Square’s rapid growth of new products, we must approach aspects of Regulator as key Square infrastructure, making it easy for other engineers to jump into it, make quick progress, and not risk destabilizing the system for current users.
 We work with a designer who has many more ideas than we can currently implement and would like to implement the next major version of our UI, but need to find the right person for the job.
 You will:
 Implement a significant new navigational system for Regulator that provides an intuitive hierarchy of information, while allowing Regulator to keep pace with new product additions coming from Register, Cash, and eventually Caviar
 Understand back-end services (ideally Ruby on Rails) but be primarily interested in working within our Ember + JavaScript front-end
 Take ownership over the structure and principles that guide our front-end development in Regulator, while contributing opinions on the back-end structuring of information that needs to be surfaced in the UI
 Help keep us up-to-date with the latest UI frameworks, occasionally interacting with Square’s Web Front End team to ensure consistency between our internal and their external-facing dashboards
 Have or develop strong expertise in CSS, using current best practices and working with our designer on a style-guide that lets us quickly communicate style expectations with other engineers while ensuring consistent styling throughout Regulator
 Help us run roll-out concurrently running versions of our UI so that we can safely try out new UIs without unduly disrupting anybody’s work
 Interact with various product team engineers to help them successfully incorporate administrative access to their products in our platform
 Learn about Square’s major product offerings, while developing systems that remain reliable in spite of occasionally unreliable vendors
 Get to know and interact directly with key internal customers on requests and UI issues with the goal of improving efficiency and improving Square’s bottom line
 Qualifications
 You have:
 BA/BS degree or equivalent practical experience
 Strong front-end UI inclinations, with strong JavaScript experience, ideally in an MVC framework such as Ember or React
 Some experience developing and debugging server-side code
 Technologies we use and teach:
 JavaScript, Ember, QUnit, Ruby on Rails, RSpec
 S2S architecture, REST APIs, protobufs
 MySQL, Redis, Hive, and Vertica
 Additional Information
 At Square, we value diversity and always treat all employees and job applicants based on merit, qualifications, competence, and talent. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We will consider for employment qualified applicants with criminal histories in a manner consistent with the requirements of the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance.
